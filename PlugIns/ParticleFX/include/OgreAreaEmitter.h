        This is an empty superclass and needs to be subclassed. Basic particle
        emitter emits particles from/in an (unspecified) area. The
        initial direction of these particles can either be a single direction
        (i.e. a line), a random scattering inside a cone, or a random
        scattering in all directions, depending the 'angle' parameter, which
        is the angle across which to scatter the particles either side of the
        base direction of the emitter.
