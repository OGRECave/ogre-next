    @remarks
        This affector (see ParticleAffector) applies randomness to the movement of the particles by
        changing the direction vectors.
    @par
        The most important parameter to control the effect is randomness. It controls the range in which
    changes are applied to each axis of the direction vector. The parameter scope can be used to limit
    the effect to a certain percentage of the particles.
