    /** Metal doesn't "map". You can directly access the unsynchronized contents
        For performance we keep many buffers as one big buffer, but for compatibility
        reasons (with GL3/DX10 HW) we treat them as separate buffers.
    @par
        This class treats mapping in a GL-style. The most usefulness is that in OS X
        we need to inform what regions were modified (flush). On iOS it serves
        no real purpose and is just a pass through with some asserts for consistency
        checking.
    @remarks
        This is a very thin/lightweight wrapper around MTLBuffer, thus:
            Caller is responsible for flushing regions before unmapping.
            Caller is responsible for proper synchronization.
            No check is performed to see if two map calls overlap.
