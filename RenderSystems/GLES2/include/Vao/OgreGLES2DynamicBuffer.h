    /** GL3+ doesn't support mapping the same buffer twice even if the regions
        don't overlap. For performance we keep many buffers as one big buffer,
        but for compatibility reasons (with GL3/DX10 HW) we treat them as
        separate buffers.
    @par
        This class takes care of mapping buffers once while allowing
        BufferInterface to map subregions of it as if they were separate
        buffers.
    @remarks
        This is a very thin/lightweight wrapper around OpenGL glMapBufferRange, thus:
            Caller is responsible for flushing regions before unmapping.
            Caller is responsible for proper synchronization.
            No check is performed to see if two map calls overlap.
