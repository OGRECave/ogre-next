        @copydoc DepthBuffer

        OpenGL supports 2 different methods: FBO & Copy.
        Each one has it's own limitations. Non-FBO methods are solved using "dummy" DepthBuffers.
        That is, a DepthBuffer pointer is attached to the RenderTarget (for the sake of consistency)
        but it doesn't actually contain a Depth surface/renderbuffer (mDepthBuffer & mStencilBuffer are
        null pointers all the time) Those dummy DepthBuffers are identified thanks to their GL context.
        Note that FBOs don't allow sharing with the main window's depth buffer. Therefore even
        when FBO is enabled, a dummy DepthBuffer is still used to manage the windows.
