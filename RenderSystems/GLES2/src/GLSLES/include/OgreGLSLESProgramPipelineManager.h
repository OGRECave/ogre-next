     that represents the active vertex and fragment program objects
     during a rendering state.  GLSL vertex and fragment program
     objects are compiled separately and then attached to a program
     object and then the program pipeline object is linked. Since
     Ogre can only handle one vertex program stage and one fragment
     program stage being active in a pass, the GLSL ES Program
     Pipeline Manager does the same.  The GLSL ES Program Pipeline
     Manager acts as a state machine and activates a pipeline
     object based on the active vertex and fragment program.
     Previously created pipeline objects are stored along with a
     unique key in a hash map for quick retrieval the next time the
     pipeline object is required.
