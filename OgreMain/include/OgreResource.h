        @remarks
            Resources are data objects that must be loaded and managed throughout
            an application. A resource might be a mesh, a texture, or any other
            piece of data - the key thing is that they must be identified by 
            a name which is unique, must be loaded only once,
            must be managed efficiently in terms of retrieval, and they may
            also be unloadable to free memory up when they have not been used for
            a while and the memory budget is under stress.
        @par
            All Resource instances must be a member of a resource group; see
            ResourceGroupManager for full details.
        @par
            Subclasses must implement:
            <ol>
            <li>A constructor, overriding the same parameters as the constructor
                defined by this class. Subclasses are not allowed to define
                constructors with other parameters; other settings must be
                settable through accessor methods before loading.</li>
            <li>The loadImpl() and unloadImpl() methods - mSize must be set 
                after loadImpl()</li>
            <li>StringInterface ParamCommand and ParamDictionary setups
                in order to allow setting of core parameters (prior to load)
                through a generic interface.</li>

    /** Interface describing a manual resource loader.
    @remarks
        Resources are usually loaded from files; however in some cases you
        want to be able to set the data up manually instead. This provides
        some problems, such as how to reload a Resource if it becomes
        unloaded for some reason, either because of memory constraints, or
        because a device fails and some or all of the data is lost.
    @par
        This interface should be implemented by all classes which wish to
        provide manual data to a resource. They provide a pointer to themselves
        when defining the resource (via the appropriate ResourceManager), 
        and will be called when the Resource tries to load. 
        They should implement the loadResource method such that the Resource 
        is in the end set up exactly as if it had loaded from a file, 
        although the implementations will likely differ between subclasses 
        of Resource, which is why no generic algorithm can be stated here. 
    @note
        The loader must remain valid for the entire life of the resource,
        so that if need be it can be called upon to re-load the resource
        at any time.
