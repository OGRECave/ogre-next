    /** Abstract class defining the interface to be implemented by particle affectors.
    @remarks
        Particle affectors modify particles in a particle system over their lifetime. They can be
        grouped into types, e.g. 'vector force' affectors, 'fader' affectors etc; each type will
        modify particles in a different way, using different parameters.
    @par
        Because there are so many types of affectors you could use, OGRE chooses not to dictate
        the available types. It comes with some in-built, but allows plugins or applications to
        extend the affector types available. This is done by subclassing ParticleAffector to have the
        appropriate emission behaviour you want, and also creating a subclass of
        ParticleAffectorFactory which is responsible for creating instances of your new affector
        type. You register this factory with the ParticleSystemManager using addAffectorFactory, and
        from then on affectors of this type can be created either from code or through text particle
        scripts by naming the type.
    @par
        This same approach is used for ParticleEmitters (which are the source of particles in a
        system). This means that OGRE is particularly flexible when it comes to creating particle
        system effects, with literally infinite combinations of affector and affector types, and
        parameters within those types.

        @remarks
            Because StringInterface holds a dictionary of parameters per class, subclasses need to
            call this to ask the base class to add it's parameters to their dictionary as well.
            Can't do this in the constructor because that runs in a non-virtual context.

            The subclass must have called it's own createParamDictionary before calling this method.
