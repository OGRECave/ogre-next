        This class defines the low-level program in assembler code, the sort used to
        directly assemble into machine instructions for the GPU to execute. By nature,
        this means that the assembler source is rendersystem specific, which is why this
        is an abstract class - real instances are created through the RenderSystem.
        If you wish to use higher level shading languages like HLSL and Cg, you need to
        use the HighLevelGpuProgram class instead.
