    /** A class for performing queries on a scene.
    @remarks
        This is an abstract class for performing a query on a scene, i.e. to retrieve
        a list of objects and/or world geometry sections which are potentially intersecting a
        given region. Note the use of the word 'potentially': the results of a scene query
        are generated based on bounding volumes, and as such are not correct at a triangle
        level; the user of the SceneQuery is expected to filter the results further if
        greater accuracy is required.
    @par
        Different SceneManagers will implement these queries in different ways to
        exploit their particular scene organisation, and thus will provide their own
        concrete subclasses. In fact, these subclasses will be derived from subclasses
        of this class rather than directly because there will be region-type classes
        in between.
    @par
        These queries could have just been implemented as methods on the SceneManager,
        however, they are wrapped up as objects to allow 'compilation' of queries
        if deemed appropriate by the implementation; i.e. each concrete subclass may
        precalculate information (such as fixed scene partitions involved in the query)
        to speed up the repeated use of the query.
    @par
        You should never try to create a SceneQuery object yourself, they should be created
        using the SceneManager interfaces for the type of query required, e.g.
        SceneManager::createSphereSceneQuery.

            are listed first.

            bounding volumes. For this reason the caller is advised to use more detailed
            intersection tests on the results if a more accurate result is required; OGRE uses
            bounds checking in order to give the most speedy results since not all applications
            need extreme accuracy.

        @param maxresults If sorting is enabled, this value can be used to constrain the maximum number
            of results that are returned. Please note (as above) that the use of bounding volumes mean
