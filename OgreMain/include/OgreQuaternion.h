            Nlerp is faster than Slerp.

            commutativity is desired in certain places, like IK animation), and
            being torque-minimal (unless shortestPath=false). However, it's performing
            the interpolation at non-constant velocity; sometimes this is desired,
            sometimes it is not. Having a non-constant velocity can produce a more
            natural rotation feeling without the need of tweaking the weights; however
            if your scene relies on the timing of the rotation or assumes it will point
            at a specific angle at a specific weight value, Slerp is a better choice.
