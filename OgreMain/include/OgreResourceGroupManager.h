        Resource group loading is in 2 phases - creating resources from

        resources. Note that you don't necessarily have to have both; it
        is quite possible to just parse all the scripts for a group (see
        ResourceGroupManager::initialiseResourceGroup, but not to
        load the resource group.

        loading per group (to do progress bars etc), provided the resources
        that are required are pre-registered.
    @par
        Defining new resource groups,  and declaring the resources you intend to
        use in advance is optional, however it is a very useful feature. In addition,
        if a ResourceManager supports the definition of resources through scripts,
        then this is the class which drives the locating of the scripts and telling
        the ResourceManager to parse them.
    @par
        There are several states that a resource can be in (the concept, not the
        object instance in this case):
        <ol>
        <li><b>Undefined</b>. Nobody knows about this resource yet. It might be
        in the filesystem, but Ogre is oblivious to it at the moment - there
        is no Resource instance. This might be because it's never been declared
        (either in a script, or using ResourceGroupManager::declareResource), or
        it may have previously been a valid Resource instance but has been
        removed, either individually through ResourceManager::remove or as a group
        through ResourceGroupManager::clearResourceGroup.</li>
        <li><b>Declared</b>. Ogre has some forewarning of this resource, either
        through calling ResourceGroupManager::declareResource, or by declaring
        the resource in a script file which is on one of the resource locations
        which has been defined for a group. There is still no instance of Resource,
        but Ogre will know to create this resource when
        ResourceGroupManager::initialiseResourceGroup is called (which is automatic
        if you declare the resource group before Root::initialise).</li>
        <li><b>Unloaded</b>. There is now a Resource instance for this resource,
        although it is not loaded. This means that code which looks for this
        named resource will find it, but the Resource is not using a lot of memory
        because it is in an unloaded state. A Resource can get into this state
        by having just been created by ResourceGroupManager::initialiseResourceGroup
        (either from a script, or from a call to declareResource), by
        being created directly from code (ResourceManager::create), or it may
        have previously been loaded and has been unloaded, either individually
        through Resource::unload, or as a group through ResourceGroupManager::unloadResourceGroup.</li>
        <li><b>Loaded</b>The Resource instance is fully loaded. This may have
        happened implicitly because something used it, or it may have been
        loaded as part of a group.</li>

        @remarks
            A resource group allows you to define a set of resources that can
            be loaded / unloaded as a unit. For example, it might be all the
            resources used for the level of a game. There is always one predefined
            resource group called ResourceGroupManager::DEFAULT_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME,
            which is typically used to hold all resources which do not need to
            be unloaded until shutdown. There is another predefined resource
            group called ResourceGroupManager::INTERNAL_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME too,
            which should be used by OGRE internal only, the resources created
            in this group aren't supposed to modify, unload or remove by user.
            You can create additional ones so that you can control the life of
            your resources in whichever way you wish.
            There is one other predefined value,
            ResourceGroupManager::AUTODETECT_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME; using this
            causes the group name to be derived at load time by searching for
            the resource in the resource locations of each group in turn.
        @par
            Once you have defined a resource group, resources which will be loaded
            as part of it are defined in one of 3 ways:
            <ol>
            <li>Manually through declareResource(); this is useful for scripted
                declarations since it is entirely generalised, and does not
                create Resource instances right away</li>
            <li>Through the use of scripts; some ResourceManager subtypes have
                script formats (e.g. .material, .overlay) which can be used
                to declare resources</li>
            <li>By calling ResourceManager::create to create a resource manually.
            This resource will go on the list for it's group and will be loaded
            and unloaded with that group</li>
            </ol>
            You must remember to call initialiseResourceGroup if you intend to use
            the first 2 types.
        @param name The name to give the resource group.
        @param inGlobalPool if true the resource will be loaded even a different
            group was requested in the load method as a parameter.

        /** Initialises a resource group.
        @remarks
            After creating a resource group, adding some resource locations, and
            perhaps pre-declaring some resources using declareResource(), but
            before you need to use the resources in the group, you
            should call this method to initialise the group. By calling this,
            you are triggering the following processes:
            <ol>
            <li>Scripts for all resource types which support scripting are
                parsed from the resource locations, and resources within them are
                created (but not loaded yet).</li>
            <li>Creates all the resources which have just pre-declared using
            declareResource (again, these are not loaded yet)</li>
            </ol>
            So what this essentially does is create a bunch of unloaded Resource entries
            in the respective ResourceManagers based on scripts, and resources
            you've pre-declared. That means that code looking for these resources
            will find them, but they won't be taking up much memory yet, until
            they are either used, or they are loaded in bulk using loadResourceGroup.
            Loading the resource group in bulk is entirely optional, but has the
            advantage of coming with progress reporting as resources are loaded.
        @par
            Failure to call this method means that loadResourceGroup will do
            nothing, and any resources you define in scripts will not be found.
            Similarly, once you have called this method you won't be able to
            pick up any new scripts or pre-declared resources, unless you
            call clearResourceGroup, set up declared resources, and call this
            method again.
        @note
            When you call Root::initialise, all resource groups that have already been
            created are automatically initialised too. Therefore you do not need to
            call this method for groups you define and set up before you call
            Root::initialise. However, since one of the most useful features of
            resource groups is to set them up after the main system initialisation
            has occurred (e.g. a group per game level), you must remember to call this
            method for the groups you create after this.

        @param name
            The name of the resource group to initialise
        @param changeLocaleTemporarily
            Ogre regrettably relies on locale conversion for parsing scripts, which means
            a script with value "1.76" will be read as "1" in some systems because the
            locale is configured to expect "1,76" instead.
            When you pass true to this function, we will temporarily change the locale
            to "C" and then restore it back when we're done.
            However this is not ideal as it may affect your program if you have
            other threads; or it could affect your code if a listener is triggered
            and you expect a particular locale; therefore the final decision of changing
            the locale is left to you.
