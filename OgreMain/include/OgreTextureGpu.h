    @remarks
        Internal layout of data in memory:
        @verbatim
            Mip0 -> Slice 0, Slice 1, ..., Slice N
            Mip1 -> Slice 0, Slice 1, ..., Slice N
            ...
            MipN -> Slice 0, Slice 1, ..., Slice N
        @endverbatim

        The layout for 3D volume and array textures is the same. The only thing that changes
        is that for 3D volumes, the number of slices also decreases with each mip, while
        for array textures it is kept constant.

        For 1D array textures, the number of slices is stored in mDepthOrSlices, not in Height.

        For code reference, look at _getSysRamCopyAsBox implementation, and TextureBox::at
        Each row of pixels is aligned to 4 bytes (except for compressed formats that require
        more strict alignments, such as alignment to the block).

        A TextureGpu loaded from file has the following life cycle, usually:
            1. At creation it's mResidencyStatus = GpuResidency::OnStorage
            2. Loading is scheduled via scheduleTransitionTo.
               mNextResidencyStatus = GpuResidency::Resident
            3. Texture transitions to resident. mResidencyStatus = GpuResidency::Resident
               isMetadataReady returns true. How fast this happens depends on whether
               there was a metadata cache or not.
            4. If there is a metadata cache, and the cache turned out to be wrong (e.g. it
               lied or was out of date), the texture will transition
               back to OnStorage and the whole process repeats from step 1.
            5. Texture finishes loading. notifyDataIsReady gets called and now
               isDataReady returns true.

        @remarks
            If you're not loading from file (i.e. you're creating it programatically),
            call _transitionTo & _setNextResidencyStatus directly.
            Once you've called scheduleTransitionTo at least once, calling _transitionTo
            is very dangerous, as there are race conditions.

            @see    TextureGpu::scheduleTransitionTo
        @param nextResidency
            The residency to change to.
        @param image
            Pointer to image if you want to load the texture from memory instead of loading
            it from file or a listener.
            Pointer must be null if this is a manual texture.
            Pointer must NOT be a stack variable nor be deleted immediately.
            The actual loading is postponed until the request reaches the worker thread.
            That means the image pointer is safe to delete once you receive the
            TextureGpuListener::Reason::ReadyForRendering message.
        @param autoDeleteImage
            Whether we should call "delete image" once we're done using the image.
            Otherwise you must listen for TextureGpuListener::ReadyForRendering
            message to know when we're done using the image.

            you'll achieve the same result, however the texture becomes immediately
            unavailable causing a few frames were all the user sees is a blank texture
            until it is fully reloaded.

            This routine allows for an in-place hot-reload, where the old texture
            is swapped for the new one once it's done loading.

            This is also faster because DescriptorTextureSets don't change

        @remarks
            1. Assumes the last queued transition to perform is into
               Resident or OnSystemRam
            2. Visual hitches are unavoidable if metadata changes (e.g. new
               texture is of different pixel format, different number of
               mipmaps, resolution, etc)
               If that's the case, it is faster to transition to OnStorage,
