        Internal layout of data in memory:

            Mip0 -> Slice 0, Slice 1, ..., Slice N
            Mip1 -> Slice 0, Slice 1, ..., Slice N
            ...
            MipN -> Slice 0, Slice 1, ..., Slice N
        @endverbatim

        The layout for 3D volume and array textures is the same. The only thing that changes
        is that for 3D volumes, the number of slices also decreases with each mip, while
        for array textures it is kept constant.

        For 1D array textures, the number of slices is stored in mDepthOrSlices, not in Height.

        For code reference, look at _getSysRamCopyAsBox implementation, and TextureBox::at
        Each row of pixels is aligned to 4 bytes (except for compressed formats that require
        more strict alignments, such as alignment to the block).

        A TextureGpu loaded from file has the following life cycle, usually:
            1. At creation it's mResidencyStatus = GpuResidency::OnStorage
            2. Loading is scheduled via scheduleTransitionTo.
               mNextResidencyStatus = GpuResidency::Resident
            3. Texture transitions to resident. mResidencyStatus = GpuResidency::Resident
               isMetadataReady returns true. How fast this happens depends on whether
               there was a metadata cache or not.
            4. If there is a metadata cache, and the cache turned out to be wrong (e.g. it
               lied or was out of date), the texture will transition
               back to OnStorage and the whole process repeats from step 1.
            5. Texture finishes loading. notifyDataIsReady gets called and now
               isDataReady returns true.

        @param preferDepthTexture
            Whether this RT should be attached to a depth texture, or a regular depth buffer.
            On older GPUs, preferring depth textures may result in certain depth precisions
            to not be available (or use integer precision instead of floating point, etc).

            Ogre will try to honour this request, but if it's not supported,
            you may get lower precision.
            All formats will try to fallback to PF_D24_UNORM_S8_UINT if not supported.
