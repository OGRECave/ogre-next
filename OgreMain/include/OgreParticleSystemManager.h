    /** Manages particle systems, particle system scripts (templates) and the
        available emitter & affector factories.
    @remarks
        This singleton class is responsible for creating and managing particle
        systems. All particle systems must be created and destroyed using this
        object, although the user interface to creating them is via
        SceneManager. Remember that like all other MovableObject
        subclasses, ParticleSystems do not get rendered until they are
        attached to a SceneNode object.
    @par
        This class also manages factories for ParticleEmitter and
        ParticleAffector classes. To enable easy extensions to the types of
        emitters (particle sources) and affectors (particle modifiers), the
        ParticleSystemManager lets plugins or applications register factory
        classes which submit new subclasses to ParticleEmitter and
        ParticleAffector. Ogre comes with a number of them already provided,
        such as cone, sphere and box-shaped emitters, and simple affectors such
        as constant directional force and colour faders. However using this
        registration process, a plugin can create any behaviour required.
    @par
        This class also manages the loading and parsing of particle system
        scripts, which are text files describing named particle system
        templates. Instances of particle systems using these templates can
        then be created easily through the createParticleSystem method.

            This method allows plugins etc to add new particle emitter types to Ogre. Particle emitters
            are sources of particles, and generate new particles with their start positions, colours and
            momentums appropriately. Plugins would create new subclasses of ParticleEmitter which
            emit particles a certain way, and register a subclass of ParticleEmitterFactory to create
        them (since multiple emitters can be created for different particle systems).
        @par
            All particle emitter factories have an assigned name which is used to identify the emitter
            type. This must be unique.

            affectors modify the particles in a system a certain way such as affecting their direction
            or changing their colour, lifespan etc. Plugins would
