    /** Representation of a dynamic light source in the scene.
    @remarks
        Lights are added to the scene like any other object. They contain various
        parameters like type, position, attenuation (how light intensity fades with
        distance), colour etc.
    @par
        The defaults when a light is created is pure white diffuse light, with no
        attenuation (does not decrease with distance) and a range of 1000 world units.
    @par
        Lights are created by using the SceneManager::createLight method. Starting Ogre 2.0
        all Lights must be associated to a SceneNode in order to work; which holds the position
        and direction.
        Light::setDirection and Light::getDirection will redirect to the SceneNode and assert
        or crash if not attached to one.
    @par
        Remember also that dynamic lights rely on modifying the colour of vertices based on the position
    of the light compared to an object's vertex normals. Dynamic lighting will only look good if the
        object being lit has a fair level of tessellation and the normals are properly set. This is
    particularly true for the spotlight which will only look right on highly tessellated models. In the
    future OGRE may be extended for certain scene types so an alternative to the standard dynamic
    lighting may be used, such as dynamic lightmaps.

                            1
            --------------------------------
            (distance / radius)Â² * 0.5 + 0.5

            The original formula never ends, that is the range is infinity. This function calculates
            a range based on "lumThreshold": When the luminosity past certain distance is below the
            established threshold, the light calculations are cut.
        @param radius
            The radius of the light. i.e. A light bulb is a couple centimeters, the sun is ~696km;
            but be sure to be consistent in the unit of measurement you use (i.e. don't use km if
            your default unit is in meters).
            Note: Having a radius = 2 means that at distance = 2 the pixel is lit 100%
            Anything inside that radius (which is supposedly impossible) will have more than 100%
            light power.
        @param lumThreshold
            Value in the range [0; 1)
            Sets range at which the luminance (in percentage) of a point would go below the threshold.
            For example lumThreshold = 0 means the attenuation range is infinity; lumThreshold = 1 means
            the range is set to 0.
        @par
            The value you want as threshold to use depends on your HDR pipeline and the power of the
            light. For example, with a power = 1 in LDR, a lumThreshold < 1 / 255 (roughly 0.00392)
            is pointless. Past that point the actual RGB value will always be (0, 0, 0).
            But for an LDR pipeline with a light power of 50, lumThreshold < 1 / (255 * 50) is
            pointless. For an HDR pipeline, the answer is more faint, as it depends on the threshold
            of your HDR tonemapping past which it stops adjusting the exposure.

        @remarks
            Lights normally get fainter the further they are away. Also, each light is given a maximum
            range beyond which it cannot affect any objects.
        @par
            Light attenuation is not applicable to directional lights since they have an infinite range
            and constant intensity.

            attenuation.

            and attach both the flashlight entity and the light to the same node; thus
            controlling the node moves both the flashlight and its visual effect.
        @par

        @remarks
            This setting is only useful for non-directional lights.
            For point lights, the scale is calculated as setSize( range, range, range )

                setSize( tan( outerAngle * 0.5 * range ), tan( outerAngle * 0.5 * range ), range );

        @remarks
            This method allows a Light to map in a custom GPU program parameter
            based on it's own data. This is represented by a GPU auto parameter
            of ACT_LIGHT_CUSTOM, and to allow there to be more than one of these per
            Light, the 'data' field on the auto parameter will identify
            which parameter is being updated and on which light. The implementation
            of this method must identify the parameter being updated, and call a 'setConstant'
            method on the passed in GpuProgramParameters object.
        @par
            You do not need to override this method if you're using the standard
            sets of data associated with the Renderable as provided by setCustomParameter
            and getCustomParameter. By default, the implementation will map from the
            value indexed by the 'constantEntry.data' parameter to a value previously
            set by setCustomParameter. But custom Renderables are free to override
            this if they want, in any case.
