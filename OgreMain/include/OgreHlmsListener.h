        on the different approaches to customizing Hlms implementations.
    @remarks
        For performance reasons, the listener interface does not allow you to add
        customizations that work per Renderable, as that loop is performance sensitive.
        The only listener callback that works inside Hlms::fillBuffersFor is hlmsTypeChanged
        which only gets evaluated when the previous Renderable used a different Hlms
        implementation; which is rare, and since we sort the RenderQueue, it often branch
        predicts well.
