    /** Defines the behaviour of an automatic renderer configuration dialog.
    @remarks
        OGRE comes with it's own renderer configuration dialog, which
        applications can use to easily allow the user to configure the
        settings appropriate to their machine. This class defines the
        interface to this standard dialog. Because dialogs are inherently
        tied to a particular platform's windowing system, there will be a
        different subclass for each platform.

        @remarks
            This method displays the dialog and from then on the dialog
            interacts with the user independently. The dialog will be
            calling the relevant OGRE rendering systems to query them for
            options and to set the options the user selects. The method
            returns when the user closes the dialog.
        @returns
            If the user accepted the dialog, <b>true</b> is returned.
        @par
            If the user cancelled the dialog (indicating the application
            should probably terminate), <b>false</b> is returned.
