        @remarks
            The Ogre::Root class represents a starting point for the client
            application. From here, the application can gain access to the
            fundamentals of the system, namely the rendering systems
            available, management of saved configurations, logging, and
            access to other classes in the system. Acts as a hub from which
            all other objects may be reached. An instance of Root must be
            created before any other Ogre operations are called. Once an
            instance has been created, the same instance is accessible
            throughout the life of that object by using Root::getSingleton
            (as a reference) or Root::getSingletonPtr (as a pointer).

                specific locations. By calling this method, you add another
                search location to the list. Locations added first are preferred
                over locations added later.

                Locations can be folders, compressed archives, even perhaps
                remote locations. Facilities for loading from different
                locations are provided by plugins which provide
                implementations of the Archive class.
                All the application user has to do is specify a 'loctype'
                string in order to indicate the type of location, which
                should map onto one of the provided plugins. Ogre comes
                configured with the 'FileSystem' (folders) and 'Zip' (archive

                have this location applied to it. The

                default, and one resource group which will always exist. You
                should consider defining resource groups for your more specific
                resources (e.g. per level) so that you can control loading /
                unloading better.

                locType A string identifying the location type, e.g.
                'FileSystem' (for folders), 'Zip' etc. Must map to a
                registered plugin which deals with this type (FileSystem and
                Zip should always be available)
            @param

                should apply to; defaults to the General group which applies to
                all non-specific resources.
            @param
                recursive If the resource location has a concept of recursive
                directory traversal, enabling this option will mean you can load
                resources in subdirectories using only their unqualified name.
