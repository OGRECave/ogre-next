/** Definition of the OGRE .skeleton file format 

    .skeleton files are binary files (for read efficiency at runtime) and are arranged into chunks 
    of data, very like 3D Studio's format.
    A chunk always consists of:
        unsigned short CHUNK_ID        : one of the following chunk ids identifying the chunk
        unsigned long  LENGTH          : length of the chunk in bytes, including this header
        void*          DATA            : the data, which may contain other sub-chunks (various data types)
    
    A .skeleton file contains both the definition of the Skeleton object and the animations it contains. It
    contains only a single skeleton but can contain multiple animations.
