    /** A lightweight mutex is a synchronization mechanism, very similar to a regular mutex.
        Regular mutexes are well known to be expensive because they need to enter & leave
        kernel mode.
    @par
        Lightweight mutexes usually make use of atomic instructions (in x86 they're referred to
        as instructions with the "lock" prefix) to avoid entering kernel mode when no other
        thread has aquired the lock.
    @par
        This comes with a couple caveats that we don't care for the applications we need,
        but is important to keep them in mind:
            1) LightweightMutexes can't be shared among processes
            2) Priority inversion is not a concern
            3) Recursive locks aren't supported (same thread calling lock() twice can deadlock)
        Note that some LightweightMutex implementations may offer this functionality, but we don't
        guarantee them in all platforms/architectures.
        It is possible to write a lightweight mutex that supports recursive locks, but that requires
        a call to GetCurrentThreadId (in Windows), which as much as saying just use a regular mutex.
    @par
        Windows users are familiar with the concept of LightweightMutexes because there is already
        an implementation provided: CRITICAL_SECTION. We go further by reinventing the wheel and
        writting it ourselves. If you ever wondered how a CRITICAL_SECTION works, now you know.
    @par
