    @class TextureGpuManager
        This class manages all textures (i.e. TextureGpu) since Ogre 2.2

        Explanation of the streaming model:

        TextureGpuManager uses a worker thread to load textures in the background.
        There are several restrictions the implementation needs to account for:
            * D3D11 does not support persistent mapping. This means we must call unmap
              on a StagingTexture before we can copy it to the final texture.
            * Calling map/unmap from multiple threads is nearly impossible in OpenGL.
              This means map/unmap calls must happen in the main thread.
            * ResourceGroupManager is not thread-friendly (building with thread
              support fills ResourceGroupManager with huge fat mutexes)
            * Most APIs allow using a simple buffer to store all sorts of staging
              data (regardless of format and resolution), but D3D11 is very inflexible
              about this, requiring StagingTextures to have a 2D resolution (rather
              than being a 1D buffer with just bytes), and must match the same
              format.

        Because of these restrictions, TextureGpuManager::scheduleLoadRequest will
        grab the Archive to load from file from ResourceGroupManager and then
        create a request for the worker thread.

        The worker thread (_updateStreamingWorkerThread) runs an infinite loop
        waiting for new requests.

        The worker thread will process incoming LoadRequest: it will open the file
        and retrieve the important information first aka the metadata (such as
        resolution, pixel format, number of mipmaps, etc). It is most likely
        the worker thread will load the whole image from disk, and not just
        the metadata (at least the first slice + first mip).

        The image is at the moment in RAM, but two things need to happen:
            1. The image must be copied to a StagingTexture so that it can
               be later be copied to the final texture.
            2. The texture must become Resident so that our API commands
               can actually work (like copying from StagingTexture to the
               final texture object)

        The worker thread will now push an entry to mStreamingData.queuedImages
        for all the slices & mips that are pending to copy from RAM to a
        StagingTexture. That includes slice 0 mip 0.

        It will also emit a command the main thread will eventually see to
        make the texture Resident (via ObjCmdBuffer::TransitionToResident)

        The worker thread will call TextureGpuManager::getStreaming to grab an
        available StagingTexture that has been pre-mapped in the main thread that
        can hold the data we want to upload.

        If no such Texture is available, we cannot upload the texture yet and this
        failure is recorded; and we do not remove the entry from mStreamingData.queuedImages
        Until mStreamingData.queuedImages[i].empty() returns true, the worker thread,
        with each new iteration, will try again to grab a StagingTexture to finish the jobs.

        From the main thread, with each TextureGpuManager::_update; fullfillBudget will
        check the recorded failures in getStreaming from the worker thread and create & map
        more StagingTextures to satisfy the worker thread.

        The main thread will also execute the transition to resident commands sent from
        the worker thread.

        This means that in worst case scenario, uploading a texture may require multiple
        ping pongs between the worker & main thread, which is why
        TextureGpuManager::waitForStreamingCompletion keeps calling _update in a loop
        until the texture is fully loaded.

        To put things into perspective: if getStreaming always failed to grab a
        StagingTexture (i.e. due to a bug), then waitForStreamingCompletion would
        be stuck in an infinite loop.

        Note that this behavior applies to both multithreaded and singlethreaded versions
        (i.e. when OGRE_FORCE_TEXTURE_STREAMING_ON_MAIN_THREAD is defined).

        When everything's done, queuedImage.empty() returns true, a
        ObjCmdBuffer::NotifyDataIsReady command to the main thread is issued,
        and the entry is removed from mStreamingData.queuedImages

        Of course, the main thread tries to predict how much StagingTexture will
        be needed by tracking past usage and by trying to fullfill mBudget
        (see TextureGpuManager::setWorkerThreadMinimumBudget), so under best case
        scenario the ping pong between worker & main thread is kept to a minimum.

        TextureGpuManager::mMaxPreloadBytes puts an upper limit to this prediction
        to prevent memory from sky-rocketing (or reaching out of memory conditions)
        during spikes. There's only so much GART/GTT memory available in a system.

        The variable mEntriesToProcessPerIteration controls how many entries in
        LoadRequests are processed per iteration in the worker thread.
        High values cause the worker thread to appear "stuck" loading lots of
        images without flushing our internal command buffer, which means
        the main thread won't see what's happening and thus unable to
        fullfull budget failure requests, predict accurately, and unable
        to perform transition to resident requests. I.e. the main thread
        will sit idle, until it suddenly sees a lot of work coming from
        the worker thread.
        Very low values can cause more threading contention due to excessive
        flushing.

        The metadata cache helps with performance by being able to know in the
        main thread before creating the LoadRequest what texture pool to reserve.
        But performance will be degraded if the metadata cache lied, as we must
        then perform multiple ping pongs between the threads to correct the error.

        @see    TextureGpu

    @remarks
        Even if you use waitForStreamingCompletion to have all of your frames
        rendering "perfectly" (i.e. prefer stalling rendering instead of showing
        a replacement texture until the real one is loaded), multithreaded
        streaming can still reduce your loading times because Ogre will
        immediately start loading the texture from disk while the main
        thread can keep executing your code (like moving on to the next Item
        or Datablock you're instantiating)

        /**
        @class QueuedImage
            When loading a texture (i.e. TextureGpuManager::scheduleLoadRequest or
            TextureGpuManager::scheduleLoadFromRam were called) the following will happen:

                1. Find if the texture has any pending transition or finishing loading
                    1a. If so place a task in mScheduledTasks
                    1b. Otherwise execute the task immediately
                2. The texture is placed from main thread in mThreadData[].loadRequests
                3. Worker thread parses that request. Assuming all goes smoothly (e.g. Image loaded
                   successfully, metadata cache was not out of date, etc) the Image is fully
                   loaded from disk into memory as an Image2.
                4. The texture is transitioned to Resident* since all metadata is available now,
                   but not yet ready for rendering. This step cannot happen if we must maintain a
                   SystemRam copy (i.e. strategy is AlwaysKeepSystemRamCopy; or we were asked
                   to load to OnSystemRam, instead of Resident)
                6. A QueuedImage is created.
                7. The LoadRequest is destroyed.
                8. Worker thread loops again, processing QueuedImages and LoadRequests

            QueuedImage will proceed to transfer from system RAM (step 3) to StagingTextures, and
            will remain alive until all of its data has been transfered. It will also be
            responsible for requesting more StagingTextures if needed.

            Once the QueuedImage is done, it will signal a ObjCmdBuffer::NotifyDataIsReady.

            If step 4 could not happen, then the QueuedImage will also perform the transition
            to resident* when we're done.

            (*) Transitions happen in main thread, however they're requested from worker thread
            via ObjCmdBuffer::TransitionToLoaded. See TextureGpuManager::addTransitionToLoadedCmd code

        @remarks
            QueuedImage class is used when is NEVER used when transitioning from OnStorage -> OnSystemRam

            There's a case in which the texture must be loaded in parts and thus more than one
            QueuedImage will be needed. See TextureGpuManager::PartialImage.

            In this case, then NotifyDataIsReady (and TransitionToLoaded if step 4 could not run)
            can only happen after all pending QueuedImage are over.

            be used; and it's important that the right dummy texture is selected.

            If there is no minimum budget or it is too small for the texture you're trying

            until the next call to _update (or to waitForStreamingCompletion).
            This controls how much memory we reserve.
        @remarks
            Be careful on reserving too much memory, or else Out of Memory situations
            could arise. The amount of memory you can reserved is limited by the
            GTT (Graphics Translation Table) and the limit may be much lower than the
            total System RAM. For example my 16GB RAM system with a 2GB GPU, the GTT
            limit on Linux is of 3GB (use radeontop to find this information).
            See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_address_remapping_table
        @param budget
            Array of parameters for the staging textures we'll reserve.
            The budget can be empty.
        @param maxSplitResolution
            Textures bigger than this resolution in any axis will be taken
            as "exceptions" or "spikes" that won't last long. e.g. if maxSplitResolution = 2048
            then a 2048x16, 67x2048, 2048x2048, and a 4096x4096 texture will all be considered abnormal.

            This can significantly affect how much memory we consume while streaming.
            A value of 0 means to keep current value.

            If an entry in the budget contains minNumSlices > 1 and minResolution >= maxSplitResolution
            then a lot of memory waste could end up being caused; thus we will warn to the Ogre.log
            if you set such setting.

            The default value in 32-bit systems and mobile is 2048
            The default value in 64-bit Desktop systems is 4096

            This setting is closely related to setWorkerThreadMaxPerStagingTextureRequestBytes,
            because a texture whose resolution is >= maxSplitResolution will force us to use
            multiple StagingTextures, thus relieving the pressure on memory and memory fragmentation.

        /** At a high level, texture loading works like this:
            1. Grab a free StagingTexture from "available" pool in main thread
            2. Load image from file in secondary thread and fill the StagingTexture
            3. Copy from StagingTexture to final TextureGpu in main thread
            4. Release the StagingTexture so it goes back to "available" pool.
            5. Repeat from step 1 for next batch of images to load.
        @par
            All is well except for one little detail in steps 1 and 4:
            The StagingTexture released at step 4 can't become immediately available
            as the GPU could still be performing the copy from step 3, so we must wait
            a few frames until it's safe to map it again.
        @par
            That means at step 1, there may be StagingTextures in the "available" pool,
            yet however none of them are actually ready to grab; so we create a new
            one instead.
        @par
            In other words, if the CPU produces textures faster than the GPU can consume
            them, we may keep creating more and more StagingTextures until we run out of memory.
        @par
            That's where this function comes in. This function limits how much we let
            the "available" pool grow. If the threshold is exceeded, instead of creating
            a new StagingTexture at step 1; we'll begin to stall and wait for the GPU
            to catch up; so we can reuse these StagingTextures again. If no StagingTexture
            is capable of performing the upload (e.g. they're of incompatible format)
            we'll start deleting StagingTextures to make room for the one we need.
            The details are explained in checkStagingTextureLimits.
        @par
            This limit is tightly respected by Ogre but not a hard one. For example
            if you set the limit on 256MB and we require a StagingTexture of 326MB
            to load a very, very big texture, then Ogre has no other choice but to
            delete all textures in mAvailableStagingTextures and create one of 326MB
            that can perform the operation; but Ogre won't error out because 326 > 256MB.
            (though in such scenario the process may run out of memory and crash)
        @remarks
            This limit only counts for textures that are in zero-referenced in
            mAvailableStagingTextures. For example if you've set the limit in 256MB and
            you've created 1GB worth of StagingTextures (i.e. via getStagingTexture) and
            never released them via removeStagingTexture; those textures don't count.
            We only check the limit against the released textures in mAvailableStagingTextures.
        @param stagingTextureMaxBudgetBytes

            we start stalling the GPU and/or aggressively destroying them.

            and then copies from RAM to StagingTexture.
            Later the main thread will copy from StagingTexture to actual texture.
        @par
            This value controls how many bytes are preloaded (i.e. from disk to RAM)
            by the worker thread until the next _update call from the main thread is issued.
        @par
            Higher values allows worker thread to keep loading textures while your main
            thread loads the rest of the scene. Lower values prevent Out of Memory conditions.
        @remarks
            Due to how the code works, this value will also affect how much StagingTexture
            we ask to the main thread (because preloading becomes a bottleneck).
        @par
            Testing shows that very high values (i.e. >256MB) have the potential of uncovering
            driver bugs (even in 64-bit builds) and thus are not recommended.
        @par
            The value is an approximation and not a hard limit. e.g. if loading a 128MB
            cubemap and the limit is 1 byte; then we'll preload 128MBs. But we won't
            be loading anything else.
            Also due to how the code works, there is some broad granularity issues that
            can cause us to consume a bit more.

            However if this happens too often in a row, we should stall and wait indefinitely

            This function allows you to specify how many failures we have to let pass before
            we stall.
        @remarks
            This is a failsafe mechanism for edge case behaviors that should never happen.
            It is rare for the tryLock() to fail more than twice in a row.

            However if loading a several big files (e.g. large cubemaps) or loading from a slow medium
            (e.g. from the internet directly) many tryLock() failures could be common.

            If failure to acquire the lock is common and expected, small limit values could cause a
            lot of stutter, because e.g. a value of 3 could cause fps lag spikes every 3 frames.

            A sensible value such as 1200 means that a stall would only happen after 20 seconds of
