        @remarks
            A 'listener' is an interface designed to be called back when
            particular events are called. This class defines the
            interface relating to frame events. In order to receive
            notifications of frame events, you should create a subclass of
            FrameListener and override the methods for which you would like
            to customise the resulting processing. You should then call
            Root::addFrameListener passing an instance of this class.
            There is no limit to the number of frame listeners you can register,
            allowing you to register multiple listeners for different purposes.
            Note that a frame event occurs once for all rendering targets,
            not once per target.

        rather than having to create 'do nothing' implementations for
        those they weren't interested in. As such this class follows
        the 'Adapter' classes in Java rather than pure interfaces.

        /** Called after all render targets have had their rendering commands
            issued, but before render windows have been asked to flip their
            buffers over.
        @remarks
            The usefulness of this event comes from the fact that rendering
            commands are queued for the GPU to process. These can take a little
            while to finish, and so while that is happening the CPU can be doing
            useful things. Once the request to 'flip buffers' happens, the thread
            requesting it will block until the GPU is ready, which can waste CPU
            cycles. Therefore, it is often a good idea to use this callback to
            perform per-frame processing. Of course because the frame's rendering
            commands have already been issued, any changes you make will only
            take effect from the next frame, but in most cases that's not noticeable.
