        @par
            Small explanation on StagingBuffer lifetime management (so you can make sense on
            what we're doing here):

            StagingBuffers may produce "pops" when created (due to API/driver stalls) so we
            reuse them. We keep track of how long StagingBuffers have been remained unused,
            and delete old ones. The intention is to be able to recycle old buffers,
            while getting rid of the excess if a sudden spike happened. That's what the lifetime
            threshold controls.

            We also have the "unfenced threshold". This controls something very different.
            StagingBuffers usages need fences to check whether we're done using the buffer.
            But we don't issue a fence every time you do something with them, because that could
            result in a lot of fences (i.e. imagine you do a 1000 uploads of 16 bytes each, in
            succession, we shouldn't do 1000 fences); so we fence when certain upload/download
            thresholds are met (i.e. you've uploaded 1MB of data). So if you've uploaded 750kb
            so far, no fence will be issued. But if you upload 300kb more, we will fence.
            But what happens if you've only uploaded 750kb and then nothing more for the last
            10 minutes? Since we haven't fenced, and now you need to upload a lot more, we don't
            know if those 750kb are done uploading because we never fenced it. It probably ended
            10 minutes ago, but we won't know. We would have to fence now and perform a full
            stall waiting for that fence. To solve this edge case, we fence whenever X time has
            elapsed without fencing (and only if there's data that remains unfenced of course).
            That's what the unfenced threshold is for.
        @param lifetime
            Time in milliseconds. The default is 5 minutes.
            A staging buffer that remained at zero ref. count for lifetime milliseconds
            will be destroyed.
        @param unfencedTime
            For efficiency reasons (API overhead), some staging buffers implementations
            will not track all hazards on fences. A staging buffer that remained at
            zero ref. count for unfencedTime milliseconds will be told to clean
            their hazards, creating the missing appropiate fences.
            unfencedTime can't be higher than lifetime.
            unfencedTime should not be too far away from lifetime, and not too soon
            either, to maximize the chances of no stalls when we finally destroy it
            and avoid excessive API overhead in keeping fences alive.
            The default is 4 minutes 59 seconds.
