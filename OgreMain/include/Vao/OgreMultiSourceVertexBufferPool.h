    /** Vertex Array Objects do not need to change when:
            The same (internal) vertex buffer is still bound.
            The same vertex format is still used.
            The same (internal) index buffer is still bound.
        This also allows for MultDrawIndirect to render multiple meshes in just one call.
        Ogre takes care of pretending that multiple different vertex buffers are indepedent
        when internally we keep everything within the same buffers.
    @par
        However multisource buffers (i.e. having position in one buffer, UVs in another) pose
        a problem: In order to keep using the same VAO, the internal distance between the
        start (offset) of the position and the start of the UVs in the buffer must remain
        the same for all the meshes using the same multisource vertex declaration.
    @par
        Here's where MultiSourceVertexBufferPool comes into play: We need an extra layer
        on top of the VaoManager to manage multisource vertex buffers, in addition to
        the regular memory management the VaoManager already performs.
    @par
        First create a MultiSourceVertexBufferPool from the VaoManager, then request
        the group of vertex buffers to this class.
    @remarks
        Only the combination of buffers returned by createVertexBuffers can be bound together.
        Trying to bind a buffer from two different createVertexBuffers calls is not allowed.

            A list of the generated vertex buffers, one per buffer source in mVertexElementsPerSource.
            WARNING: Can be empty if the pool is out of memory or too fragmented to honour this request,
            in which case you need to use another pool (or free some memory from this pool).
        @param numVertices
            The number of vertices for these vertex buffer.
        @param initialData
            Initial data the buffer will hold upon creation. Can be null (i.e. you plan to upload later).
            Cannot be null when bufferType is BT_IMMUTABLE. Must have enough room to prevent an overflow.
            If non-null, the buffer must hold enough data for each vertex buffers.
            E.g. If mVertexElementsPerSource.size() == 3 then this is valid:
                initialData = 0;
            This is also valid:
                initialData[0] = buffer[numVertices * sumOfBytes(mVertexElementsPerSource[0])];
                initialData[1] = 0; //Unless bufferType == BT_IMMUTABLE
                initialData[2] = buffer[numVertices * sumOfBytes(mVertexElementsPerSource[2])];

            This is invalid:
                initialData[0] = whatever;
                initialData[1] = out of bounds;
        @param keepAsShadow
            Whether to keep the pointer "initialData" as a shadow copy of the contents.
            @See BufferPacked::BufferPacked regarding on who is responsible for freeing this pointer
            and what happens if an exception was raised.
