    /** A staging buffer is a buffer that resides on the GPU and be written to/from both CPU & GPU
        However the access in both cases is limited. GPUs can only copy (i.e. memcpy) to another
        real buffer (can't be used directly as i.e. texture or vertex buffer) and CPUs can only
        map it.
        In other words, a staging buffer is an intermediate buffer to transfer data between
        CPU & GPU
    @remarks
        The interface is very similar to BufferPacked (@see BufferPacked) but it's not the same.
        A staging buffer can only map/unmap, and it's mapping operations don't accept an "elementStart"
        argument. Staging buffers always deal with bytes, not elements or bytes per element.
        RenderSystem implementations also synchronize the mapping differently to avoid excessive
        memory waste or stalling.
    @par
        Internally, the staging buffer will have a maximum size and use it as a ring buffer. i.e. if
        you have a 32MB staging buffer, you can upload 4 meshes of 8 MBs each. On the 5th one the
        system will first check if the first mesh has already been copied, otherwise it will stall.
        Trying to map more bytes than the total size is an error.
    @par
        Staging buffers can't be persistently mapped, since it beats the point.

            Meanwhile, the Staging Buffer will live in a pool until it's requested again or
            the time threshold is met. This prevents unwanted hiccups due to buffers getting
            recreated and destroyed all the time.
            Keep a non-zero ref. count to ensure the StagingBuffer won't be deleted due
            to timeouts (i.e. you know this buffer will get used at long regular intervals,
            like once every 15 minutes)
        @par
            Having a non-zero reference count doesn't mean the pointer will live forever though,
