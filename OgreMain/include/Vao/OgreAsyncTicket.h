    /** In Ogre 2.0 data structures, reading data from GPU back to CPU is asynchronous.
        @See BufferPacked::readRequest to generate a ticket. While the async transfer
        is being performed, you should be doing something else.
    @remarks
        If you call map() before the transfer is done, it will produce a stall as the
        CPU must wait for the GPU to finish all its pending operations.
    @par
        Use @queryIsTransferDone to query if the transfer has finished. Beware not all
        APIs support querying async transfer status. In those cases there is no reliable
        way to determine when the transfer is done. An almost safe bet is to wait two
        frames before mapping.
    @par
        Call @BufferPacked::disposeTicket when you're done with this ticket.
