        @remarks
            Not all RS API separate by shader stage. For best compatibility,
            don't assign two different buffers at the same slot for different
            stages (just leave the slot empty on the stages you don't use).
        @param slot
            The slot to asign this constant buffer. In D3D11 it's called 'slot'.
            In GLSL it's called it's called 'binding'
        @param offset
            0-based offset. It is possible to bind a region of the buffer.
            Offset needs to be aligned. You can query the RS capabilities for
            the alignment, however 256 bytes is the maximum allowed alignment
            per the OpenGL specification, making it a safe bet to hardcode.
        @param sizeBytes
            Size in bytes to bind the tex buffer. When zero,
            binds from offset until the end of the buffer.
