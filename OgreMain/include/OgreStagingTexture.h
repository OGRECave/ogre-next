    /** A StagingTexture is an intermediate texture that can be read and be written from both
        CPU & GPU.
        However the access in both cases is limited. GPUs can only copy (i.e. memcpy) to another
        real texture (can't be used directly as a texture or render target) and CPUs can only
        map it.
        In other words, a staging texture is an intermediate to transfer data between CPU & GPU
    @par
        How to write to 2 textures (texture0 & texture1; we pass twice the amount of slices
        to getStagingTexture):
        TextureGpuManager &textureManager = ...;
        StagingTexture *stagingTexture = textureManager.getStagingTexture( width, height, depth,
                                                                           slices * 2, pixelFormat );
        stagingTexture->startMapRegion();
        TextureBox box0 = stagingTexture->mapRegion( width, height, depth, slices, pixelFormat );
        ... write to box0.data ...
        TextureBox box1 = stagingTexture->mapRegion( width, height, depth, slices, pixelFormat );
        ... write to box1.data ...
        stagingTexture->stopMapRegion();
        stagingTexture->upload( box0, texture0 );
        stagingTexture->upload( box1, texture1 );
        textureManager.removeStagingTexture( stagingTexture );
    @par
        There are other possibilities, as you can request a StagingTexture with twice the
        width & height and then start calling mapRegion with smaller textures and we'll
        handle the packing. However you have to check mapRegion doesn't return nullptr
        in TextureBox::data. If so, that means we have ran out of space.
