    /** A viewpoint from which the scene will be rendered.
    @remarks
        OGRE renders scenes from a camera viewpoint into a buffer of
        some sort, normally a window or a texture (a subclass of
        RenderTarget). OGRE cameras support both perspective projection (the default,
        meaning objects get smaller the further away they are) and
        orthographic projection (blueprint-style, no decrease in size
        with distance). Each camera carries with it a style of rendering,
        e.g. full textured, flat shaded, wireframe), field of view,
        rendering distances etc, allowing you to use OGRE to create
        complex multi-window views if required. In addition, more than
        one camera can point at a single render target if required,
        each rendering to a subset of the target, allowing split screen
        and picture-in-picture views.
    @par
        Cameras maintain their own aspect ratios, field of view, and frustum,
        and project co-ordinates into a space measured from -1 to 1 in x and y,
        and 0 to 1 in z. At render time, the camera will be rendering to a
        Viewport which will translate these parametric co-ordinates into real screen
        co-ordinates. Obviously it is advisable that the viewport has the same
        aspect ratio as the camera to avoid distortion (unless you want it!).
    @par
        Starting Ogre 2.x, a Camera must be attached to a SceneNode, using the
        method SceneNode::attachObject. By default the camera is attached to
        the root scene node on creation.
        When this is done the Camera will combine it's own
        position/orientation settings with it's parent SceneNode. 
        This is also useful for implementing more complex Camera / object
        relationships i.e. having a camera attached to a world object.

            - by default, the camera yaws around a fixed Y axis. This is 
            often what you want - for example if you're making a first-person 
            shooter, you really don't want the yaw axis to reflect the local 
            camera Y, because this would mean a different yaw axis if the 
            player is looking upwards rather than when they are looking
            straight ahead. You can change this behaviour by calling this 
            method, which you will want to do if you are making a completely

            attached to this target node is quite big and you want to point the camera at
            a specific point on it, provide a vector in the 'offset' parameter and the 
            camera's target point will be adjusted.
        @param enabled If true, the Camera will track the SceneNode supplied as the next 
            parameter (cannot be null). If false the camera will cease tracking and will
            remain in it's current orientation.
        @param target Pointer to the SceneNode which this Camera will track. Make sure you don't
            delete this SceneNode before turning off tracking (e.g. SceneManager::clearScene will
            delete it so be careful of this). Can be null if and only if the enabled param is false.
        @param offset If supplied, the camera targets this point in local space of the target node

        @remarks
            This method can be used to influence the overall level of detail of the scenes 
            rendered using this camera. Various elements of the scene have level-of-detail
            reductions to improve rendering speed at distance; this method allows you 
            to hint to those elements that you would like to adjust the level of detail that
            they would normally use (up or down). 
        @par
            The most common use for this method is to reduce the overall level of detail used
            for a secondary camera used for sub viewports like rear-view mirrors etc.
            Note that scene elements are at liberty to ignore this setting if they choose,
            this is merely a hint.
        @param factor The factor to apply to the usual level of detail calculation. Higher
