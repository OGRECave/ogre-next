        /** A billboard is a primitive which always faces the camera in every frame.
            @remarks
                Billboards can be used for special effects or some other trickery which requires the
                triangles to always facing the camera no matter where it is. Ogre groups billboards into
                sets for efficiency, so you should never create a billboard on it's own (it's ok to have
           a set of one if you need it).
            @par
                Billboards have their geometry generated every frame depending on where the camera is. It
           is most beneficial for all billboards in a set to be identically sized since Ogre can take
           advantage of this and save some calculations - useful when you have sets of hundreds of
           billboards as is possible with special effects. You can deviate from this if you wish
           (example: a smoke effect would probably have smoke puffs expanding as they rise, so each
           billboard will legitimately have it's own size) but be aware the extra overhead this brings
           and try to avoid it if you can.
            @par
                Billboards are just the mechanism for rendering a range of effects such as particles. It
           is other classes which use billboards to create their individual effects, so the methods here
           are quite generic.
