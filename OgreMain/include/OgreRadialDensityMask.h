    @class RadialDensityMaskVrGenerator
        Manages a full screen stereo rectangle that masks rectangles in the periphery and then
        reconstruct these blocks. This allows us to shade at different rates e.g. 1x2, 2x2, 4x4

        It's not as efficient or its quality as good as Variable Rate Shading (because VRS
        shades at lower frequency but it still evaluates the depth buffer at full resolution),
        but it is compatible with all HW.

        Used as an optimization for VR.
