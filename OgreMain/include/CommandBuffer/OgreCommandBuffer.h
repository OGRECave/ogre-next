    /** Command Buffer implementation.
        This interface is very sensitive to performance. For this reason:
    @par
        1. Each command has a fixed size (@see COMMAND_FIXED_SIZE)
           Whether a command uses all of the bytes is up to them.
    @par
        2. The command is stored as a flat contiguous array.
    @par
        3. Instead of implementing each command as a virtual function
           to the base class 'CbBase', we use C-style function pointers
           and manually maintain the table. This allows nifty optimizations
           (i.e. a vtable in a 64-bit arch needs 8 bytes!) and storing
           the commands as POD in the flat array (instead of having an
           array of pointers, and having to call virtual destructors).
