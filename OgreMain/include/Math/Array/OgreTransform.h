            A normal "=" operator, or an assignment constructor Transform( Transform & )
            wouldn't work. This is because ArrayVector3 & co. would try to copy all the
            packed values, while we just want the scalar ones.

            Furthermore, it would be confusing, because it would be not clear whether
            those two options should memcpy memory, or rebase the pointers, hence
            explicit functions are much preferred. @See rebasePtrs

            Note that we do NOT copy the mIndex member.
