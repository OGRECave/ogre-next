        (Structure of Arrays) implementations.
    @remarks
        This class works by requesting slots from preallocated chunks, and then releasing those slots.
        This implementation is most efficient when using LIFO patterns. Since Entities & SceneNodes
        use this manager, this means that you should create the most static ones first, and the most
        dynamic ones last (i.e. the ones that are going to be frequently inserted & removed from scene)
        @par
        WARNING: This class requires its owner to manually call initialize() and destroy() after all
        instances have been destroyed. Otherwise memory leaks will happen!

            rebased (alter it's mChunkBase pointer).

            It consists in two steps: First build a list of relative differences before deallocation
            and then apply the new base offseting based on that list. The list is needed because
            as per C++ standard, once the memory freed, using the pointers is undefined behavior
            (even freedPtr > someValid pointer is now UB). Most systems using a flat memory model
            in which case the list wouldn't be needed (since 99% of the times, the ptr is just an
            integer). However we can't guarantee in which architectures this code will run on.

                Array containing the cleanup function that will be called when performing cleanups.
                Many pointers can use the flatCleaner and is the fastest. However Array variables
                (i.e. ArrayVector3) have a layout where flatCleaner won't work correctly because

                The threshold at which a cleanup is triggered after too many nodes have been

                Maximum amount of SceneNodes. The manager is not allowed to grow and consume more
                memory past that limit. MAX_MEMORY_SLOTS for no limit. This is useful when target

                Note that if hintMaxNodes < maxHardLimit, the manager may be forced to do temporary
                allocations (to do the reallocs) thus during a brief perdiod of time it may consume
                more memory than the established hard limit (up to 2x).
