        @remarks
            Often it's useful to have temporary buffers which are used for working
            but are not necessarily needed permanently. However, creating and
            destroying buffers is expensive, so we need a way to share these
            working areas, especially those based on existing fixed buffers.
            This class represents a licensee of one of those temporary buffers,
            and must be implemented by any user of a temporary buffer if they
            wish to be notified when the license is expired.

            work, and also a very simple subclass of HardwareBufferManager which
            simply constructs the instance of the HardwareBufferManagerBase subclass
            and passes it to the HardwareBufferManager superclass as a delegate.
            This subclass must also delete the implementation instance it creates.

                This method creates a new vertex buffer; this will act as a source of geometry
                data for rendering objects. Note that because the meaning of the contents of
                the vertex buffer depends on the usage, this method does not specify a
                vertex format; the user of this buffer can actually insert whatever data
                they wish, in any format. However, in order to use this with a RenderOperation,
                the data in this vertex buffer will have to be associated with a semantic element
                of the rendering pipeline, e.g. a position, or texture coordinates. This is done
                using the VertexDeclaration class, which itself contains VertexElement structures
                referring to the source data.
            @remarks Note that because vertex buffers can be shared, they are reference
                counted so you do not need to worry about destroying themm this will be done
                automatically.
            @param vertexSize
                The size in bytes of each vertex in this buffer; you must calculate

                update regularly, consider HBU_DYNAMIC_WRITE_ONLY and useShadowBuffer=true.
            @param useShadowBuffer
                If set to @c true, this buffer will be 'shadowed' by one stored in
                system memory rather than GPU or AGP memory. You should set this flag if you intend
                to read data back from the vertex buffer, because reading data from a buffer
                in the GPU or AGP memory is very expensive, and is in fact impossible if you
                specify HBU_WRITE_ONLY for the main buffer. If you use this option, all
                reads and writes will be done to the shadow buffer, and the shadow buffer will

            implementation is in a .h file, which means it gets compiled
            into anybody who includes it. This is needed for the
            Singleton template to work, but we actually only want it
            compiled into the implementation of the class based on the
            Singleton, not all of them. If we don't change this, we get
            link errors when trying to use the Singleton-based class from
            an outside dll.
            @par
            This method just delegates to the template version anyway,
            but the implementation stays in this single compilation unit,
            preventing link errors.
