        world matrix (or a collection of world matrices which are blended by weights), and must be 
        renderable via a single render operation.

        classes e.g. entities. Only once it is decided that the specific class is to be rendered is the abstract version
        created (could be more than one per visible object) and pushed onto the rendering queue.

        @remarks
            OGRE is a queued renderer, so the actual render commands are executed 
            at a later time than the point at which an object is discovered to be
            visible. This allows ordering & grouping of renders without the discovery
            process having to be aware of it. It also means OGRE uses declarative
            render information rather than immediate mode rendering - this is very useful
            in that certain effects and processes can automatically be applied to 
            a wide range of scenes, but the downside is that special cases are
            more difficult to handle, because there is not the declared state to 
            cope with it. 
        @par
            This method allows a Renderable to do something special at the actual
            point of rendering if it wishes to. When this method is called, all the
            material render state as declared by this Renderable has already been set, 
            all that is left to do is to bind the buffers and perform the render. 
            The Renderable may modify render state itself if it wants to (and restore it in the 
            postRender call) before the automated render happens, or by returning
            'false' from this method can actually suppress the automatic render
            and perform one of its own.
        @return

            the assumption that the Renderable has done it manually.

            must identify the parameter being updated, and call a 'setConstant' 
            method on the passed in GpuProgramParameters object, using the details
