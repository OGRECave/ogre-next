        @remarks
            Ogre is designed to be platform-independent, but some platform
            and run-time environment specific optimised functions are built-in
            to maximise performance, and those special optimised routines are
            need to determine run-time environment for select variant executing
            path.
        @par
            This class manages that provides a couple of functions to determine
            platform information of the run-time environment.
        @note
            This class is supposed to use by advanced user only.
