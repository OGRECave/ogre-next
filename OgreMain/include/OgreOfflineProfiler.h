    @class OfflineProfiler
        Simple profiler that will produce a CSV file for offline
        analysis once dumpProfileResults is called
    @remarks
        Because this profiler collects sample undefinitely, it will cause
        memory consumption to grow over time.
        You can use setPaused to halt such growth temporarily, which is
        specially useful if whatever you want to profile is localized to
        particular execution moment.
