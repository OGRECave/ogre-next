    /** This class allows you to plug in new ways to define the camera setup when
        rendering and projecting shadow textures.
    @remarks
        The default projection used when rendering shadow textures is a uniform
        frustum. This is pretty straight forward but doesn't make the best use of
        the space in the shadow map since texels closer to the camera will be larger,
        resulting in 'jaggies'. There are several ways to distribute the texels
        in the shadow texture differently, and this class allows you to override
        that.
    @par
        Ogre is provided with several alternative shadow camera setups, including
        LiSPSM (LiSPSMShadowCameraSetup) and Plane Optimal (PlaneOptimalShadowCameraSetup).
        Others can of course be written to incorporate other algorithms. All you
        have to do is instantiate one of these classes and enable it using
        SceneManager::setShadowCameraSetup (global) or Light::setCustomShadowCameraSetup
        (per light). In both cases the instance is wrapped in a SharedPtr which means
        it will  be deleted automatically when no more references to it exist.
    @note
        Shadow map matrices, being projective matrices, have 15 degrees of freedom.
        3 of these degrees of freedom are fixed by the light's position.  4 are used to
        affinely affect z values.  6 affinely affect u,v sampling.  2 are projective
        degrees of freedom.  This class is meant to allow custom methods for
        handling optimization.
