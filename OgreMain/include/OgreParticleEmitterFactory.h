    @remarks
        Plugins or 3rd party applications can add new types of particle emitters to Ogre by creating
        subclasses of the ParticleEmitter class. Because multiple instances of these emitters may be
        required, a factory class to manage the instances is also required.
    @par
        ParticleEmitterFactory subclasses must allow the creation and destruction of ParticleEmitter
        subclasses. They must also be registered with the ParticleSystemManager. All factories have
        a name which identifies them, examples might be 'point', 'cone', or 'box', and these can be
        also be used from particle system scripts.
