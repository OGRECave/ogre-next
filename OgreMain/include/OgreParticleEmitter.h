    /** Abstract class defining the interface to be implemented by particle emitters.
    @remarks
        Particle emitters are the sources of particles in a particle system.
        This class defines the ParticleEmitter interface, and provides a basic implementation
        for tasks which most emitters will do (these are of course overridable).
        Particle emitters can be  grouped into types, e.g. 'point' emitters, 'box' emitters etc; each
    type will create particles with a different starting point, direction and velocity (although within
    the types you can configure the ranges of these parameters).
    @par
        Because there are so many types of emitters you could use, OGRE chooses not to dictate
        the available types. It comes with some in-built, but allows plugins or applications to extend
    the emitter types available. This is done by subclassing ParticleEmitter to have the appropriate
    emission behaviour you want, and also creating a subclass of ParticleEmitterFactory which is
    responsible for creating instances of your new emitter type. You register this factory with the
    ParticleSystemManager using addEmitterFactory, and from then on emitters of this type can be created
    either from code or through text particle scripts by naming the type.
    @par
        This same approach is used for ParticleAffectors (which modify existing particles per frame).
        This means that OGRE is particularly flexible when it comes to creating particle system effects,
        with literally infinite combinations of emitter and affector types, and parameters within those
        types.
