    /** Implements the plane optimal shadow camera algorithm.
        @remarks
            Given a plane of interest, it is possible to set up the shadow camera
            matrix such that the mapping between screen and shadow map is the identity
            (when restricted to pixels that view the plane of interest).  Therefore,
            if the shadow map resolution matches the screen space resolution (of the
            seen planar receiver), we can get pixel perfect shadowing on the plane.
            Off the plane, the shadowing is not guaranteed to be perfect and will
            likely exhibit the usual sampling artifacts associated with shadow mapping.
        @note Important: this routine requires double-precision calculations. When you
            are running under Direct3D, you must ensure that you set the floating
            point mode to 'Consistent' rather than 'Fastest' to ensure this precision.
            This does allegedly come with some performance cost but when measuring
            it appears to be negligible in modern systems for normal usage.
        @note Second important note: this projection also only works for lights with
            a finite position. Therefore you cannot use it for directional lights
            at this time.
