    /** Interface to a general purpose request / response style background work queue.
    @remarks
        A work queue is a simple structure, where requests for work are placed
        onto the queue, then removed by a worker for processing, then finally
        a response is placed on the result queue for the originator to pick up
        at their leisure. The typical use for this is in a threaded environment,
        although any kind of deferred processing could use this approach to
        decouple and distribute work over a period of time even
        if it was single threaded.
    @par
        WorkQueues also incorporate thread pools. One or more background worker threads
        can wait on the queue and be notified when a request is waiting to be
        processed. For maximal thread usage, a WorkQueue instance should be shared
        among many sources of work, rather than many work queues being created.
        This way, you can share a small number of hardware threads among a large
        number of background tasks. This doesn't mean you have to implement all the
        request processing in one class, you can plug in many handlers in order to
        process the requests.
    @par
        This is an abstract interface definition; users can subclass this and
        provide their own implementation if required to centralise task management
        in their own subsystems. We also provide a default implementation in the
        form of DefaultWorkQueue.

        set to true, and OGRE_THREAD_SUPPORT=1, but this puts extra strain
        on the thread safety of the render system and is not recommended.
        It is best to perform CPU-side work in these handlers and let the
        response handler transfer results to the GPU in the main render thread.
