    /** TagPoints are like SceneNodes, that can be children of a Bone.

        Q: Can I use a SceneNode as child of a Bone?
        A: No.

        Q: Can I use a TagPoint as child of a Bone?
        A: Yes. That's the idea.

        Q: Can I use a SceneNode as child of a TagPoint?
        A: Yes.

        Q: Can I use a TagPoint as child of a TagPoint?
        A: Yes.

        Q: Can I use a TagPoint as child of a SceneNode?
        A: Yes.

        Q: Is there a performance hit for using a TagPoint as a SceneNode?
        A: No, though there is higher memory consumption (and indirectly could
           decrease performance by affecting the cache or the bandwidth)

        Q: So... TagPoints are better than SceneNodes, because they can be used
           like SceneNodes, but also be used with bones?
        A: Yes.

        Q: Why not merge TagPoints into SceneNodes then, and remove TagPoints?
        A: Good question. Theoretically the TagPoint functionality does not
           belong to SceneNode (more dependencies, more clutter in the same
           cpp files).
           Also TagPoints require more memory; which can add up when you have
           tens of thousands (or +100k's) of nodes.
           Only pay for what you use.

        Q: Can I attach a TagPoint to Skeleton 'A' bone, and then attach an Item/Entity
           with Skeleton 'B' to this TagPoint?
        A: Yesish. It will work, but Skeleton B will see the changes from Skeleton A
           with one frame of latency (i.e. lag behind). If the animation is too fast
           or too different between frames, it may be noticeable.
           That's because we update Skeleton A, then B, then the TagPoints.
           To fix this we would have to update Skeleton 'A', then the TagPoints, then
           Skeleton 'B'; which is too cumbersome for such rare corner case.

        Q: What happens on circular dependencies? i.e. Skeleton gets attached to
           TagPoint, TagPoint gets attached to bone of said Skeleton?
        A: Undefined. Probably very wonky behavior.

        Q: What happens if I call setStatic( true )?
        A: If the TagPoint is ultimately the child of a Bone, then nothing happens.
           If the TagPoint is ultimately the child of the Root SceneNode, then it
           works as usual.

        Q: What happens if I called setStatic( true ) on a TagPoint that belonged
           to the Root SceneNode, and now I've detached, and attached it to a bone?
        A: The information about being static is completely lost (i.e. it's like
           calling setStatic( false ) prior to attaching to the bone)
