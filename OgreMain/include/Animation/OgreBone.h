    /** Class representing a Bone in the join hierarchy of a skeleton.
        @remarks
            Unlike 1.9; a Bone is practically a SceneNode in all purposes. It can even have
            objects directly attached to them. The only reason we need to overload is because
            the mDerivedTransform matrix is constructed differently, since it is not in world
            space, but rather in "offset space" (world space minus the reverse transform of the
            original bind pose).
            mDerivedPosition, mDeriverdOrientation and mDerivedScale are still in world space
            though, it's only the 4x4 matrix we send to the GPU that is in a different space.
