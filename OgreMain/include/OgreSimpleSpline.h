    @remarks
        Splines are bendy lines. You define a series of points, and the spline forms
        a smoother line between the points to eliminate the sharp angles.
    @par
        Catmull-Rom splines are a specialisation of the general Hermite spline. With
        a Hermite spline, you define the start and end point of the line, and 2 tangents,
        one at the start of the line and one at the end. The Catmull-Rom spline simplifies
        this by just asking you to define a series of points, and the tangents are
        created for you.

        @remarks
            The spline calculates tangents at each point automatically based on the input points.
            Normally it does this every time a point changes. However, if you have a lot of points
            to add in one go, you probably don't want to incur this overhead and would prefer to
            defer the calculation until you are finished setting all the points. You can do this
            by calling this method with a parameter of 'false'. Just remember to manually call
            the recalcTangents method when you are done.
        @param autoCalc If true, tangents are calculated for you whenever a point changes. If false,
            you must call reclacTangents to recalculate them when it best suits.

            then you must call this after completing your updates to the spline points.
