    /** Defines an instance of a discrete, movable object based on a Mesh.
    @remarks
        Ogre generally divides renderable objects into 2 groups, discrete
        (separate) and relatively small objects which move around the world,
        and large, sprawling geometry which makes up generally immovable
        scenery, aka 'level geometry'.
    @par
        The Mesh and SubMesh classes deal with the definition of the geometry
        used by discrete movable objects. Entities are actual instances of
        objects based on this geometry in the world. Therefore there is
        usually a single set Mesh for a car, but there may be multiple
        entities based on it in the world. Entities are able to override
        aspects of the Mesh it is defined by, such as changing material
        properties per instance (so you can have many cars using the same
        geometry but different textures for example). Because a Mesh is split
        into SubMeshes for this purpose, the Item class is a grouping class
        (much like the Mesh class) and much of the detail regarding
        individual changes is kept in the SubItem class. There is a 1:1
        relationship between SubItem instances and the SubMesh instances
        associated with the Mesh the Item is based on.
    @par
        Item and SubItem classes are never created directly. Use the
        createItem method of the SceneManager (passing a model name) to
        create one.
    @par
        Entities are included in the scene by associating them with a
        SceneNode, using the attachItem method. See the SceneNode class
        for full information.
    @note
        No functions were declared virtual to improve performance.

            Due to the nature of skeleton sharing, all slaves will end up in the position
            of the master. Therefore it is highly recommended you attach the slaves and
            master to the same SceneNode, or that you keep all SceneNodes' transforms in
            sync.
            Failure to do so could cause Ogre to cull some of those objects because
            it thinks they're located somewhere else.
