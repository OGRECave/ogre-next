            Note that only textures of the same resolution and format can be put together in
            the same pool. This creates two issues:
                * Unless it is known in advance, we do not know how large the array should be.
                  if we create a pool that can hold 64 entries but only 1 texture is actually
                  needed, then we waste a lot of GPU memory.
                * Large textures, such as 4096x4096 RGBA8 occupy a lot of memory 64MB.
                  These pools should not contain a large number of entries. For example
                  creating a pool of 8 entries of these textures means we'd be asking the
                  OS for 512MB of *contiguous* memory. Due to memory fragmentation, such
                  request is likely to fail and cause Out of Memory conditions.
        @param texture
            The first texture to which will be creating a pool based on its parameters
        @param textureManager
            The manager, in case you need more info.
        @return
            How many entries the pool should be able to hold.
