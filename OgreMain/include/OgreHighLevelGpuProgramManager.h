    @remarks
        High-level vertex and fragment programs can be used instead of assembler programs
        as managed by GpuProgramManager; however they typically result in a GpuProgram
        being created as a derivative of the high-level program. High-level programs are
        easier to write, and can often be API-independent, unlike assembler programs.
    @par
        This class not only manages the programs themselves, it also manages the factory
        classes which allow the creation of high-level programs using a variety of high-level
        syntaxes. Plugins can be created which register themselves as high-level program
        factories and as such the engine can be extended to accept virtually any kind of
        program provided a plugin is written.

        into anybody who includes it. This is needed for the
        Singleton template to work, but we actually only want it
        compiled into the implementation of the class based on the
        Singleton, not all of them. If we don't change this, we get
        link errors when trying to use the Singleton-based class from
        an outside dll.
        @par
        This method just delegates to the template version anyway,
        but the implementation stays in this single compilation unit,
        preventing link errors.
