    @remarks
        The Image class usually holds uncompressed image data and is the
        only object that can be loaded in a texture. Image objects handle
        image data decoding themselves by the means of locating the correct
        Codec object for each data type.
    @par
        Typically, you would want to use an Image object to load a texture
        when extra processing needs to be done on an image before it is
        loaded or when you want to blit to an existing texture.
