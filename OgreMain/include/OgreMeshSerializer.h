        /** Class for serialising mesh data to/from an OGRE .mesh file.
        @remarks
            This class allows exporters to write OGRE .mesh files easily, and allows the
            OGRE engine to import .mesh files into instantiated OGRE Meshes.
            Note that a .mesh file can include not only the Mesh, but also definitions of
            any Materials it uses (although this is optional, the .mesh can rely on the
            Material being loaded from another source, especially useful if you want to
            take advantage of OGRE's advanced Material properties which may not be available
            in your modeller).
        @par
            To export a Mesh:<OL>
            <LI>Use the MaterialManager methods to create any dependent Material objects, if you want
                to export them with the Mesh.</LI>
            <LI>Create a Mesh object and populate it using it's methods.</LI>
            <LI>Call the exportMesh method</LI>
            </OL>
        @par
            It's important to realise that this exporter uses OGRE terminology. In this context,
            'Mesh' means a top-level mesh structure which can actually contain many SubMeshes, each
            of which has only one Material. Modelling packages may refer to these differently, for
            example in Milkshape, it says 'Model' instead of 'Mesh' and 'Mesh' instead of 'SubMesh',
            but the theory is the same.
