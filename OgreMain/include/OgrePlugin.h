    /** Class defining a generic OGRE plugin.
    @remarks
        OGRE is very plugin-oriented and you can customise much of its behaviour
        by registering new plugins, dynamically if you are using dynamic linking.
        This class abstracts the generic interface that all plugins must support.
        Within the implementations of this interface, the plugin must call other
        OGRE classes in order to register the detailed customisations it is
        providing, e.g. registering a new SceneManagerFactory, a new
        MovableObjectFactory, or a new RenderSystem.
    @par
        Plugins can be linked statically or dynamically. If they are linked
        dynamically (ie the plugin is in a DLL or Shared Object file), then you
        load the plugin by calling the Root::loadPlugin method (or some other
        mechanism which leads to that call, e.g. plugins.cfg), passing the name of
        the DLL. OGRE will then call a global init function on that DLL, and it
        will be expected to register one or more Plugin implementations using
        Root::installPlugin. The procedure is very similar if you use a static
        linked plugin, except that you simply instantiate the Plugin implementation
        yourself and pass it to Root::installPlugin.
    @note
        Lifecycle of a Plugin instance is very important. The Plugin instance must
        remain valid until the Plugin is uninstalled. Here are the things you
        must bear in  mind:
        <ul><li>If your plugin is in a DLL:
        <ul><li>Create the Plugin instance and call Root::installPlugin in dllStartPlugin</li>
        <li>Call Root::uninstallPlugin, then delete it in dllStopPlugin</li></ul>
        <li>If your plugin is statically linked in your app:
        <ul><li>Create the Plugin anytime you like</li>
        <li>Call Root::installPlugin any time whilst Root is valid</li>
        <li>Call Root::uninstallPlugin if you like so long as Root is valid. However,
            it will be done for you when Root is destroyed, so the Plugin instance must
            still be valid at that point if you haven't manually uninstalled it.</li></ul>
        </ul>
        The install and uninstall methods will be called when the plugin is
        installed or uninstalled. The initialise and shutdown will be called when
        there is a system initialisation or shutdown, e.g. when Root::initialise
        or Root::shutdown are called.

        such as rendersystems being shut down. You should use this hook to free up
        resources and decouple custom objects from the OGRE system, whilst all the
        instances of other plugins (e.g. rendersystems) still exist.

        (e.g. final deletion of custom instances, if you kept them around incase
        the system was reinitialised). At this stage you cannot be sure what other
        plugins are still loaded or active. It must therefore not perform any
        operations that would reference any rendersystem-specific objects - those
        should have been sorted out in the 'shutdown' method.
