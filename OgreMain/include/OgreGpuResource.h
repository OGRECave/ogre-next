        /** When getResidencyStatus() != getNextResidencyStatus(), residency changes happen
            in the main thread, while some preparation may be happening in the background.

            For example when a texture is not resident but getNextResidencyStatus says it will,
            a background thread is loading the texture file from disk, but the actual transition
            won't happen until the main thread changes it. You can call texture->waitForData()
            which will stall, as the main thread will be communicating back and forth with the
            background to see if it's ready; and when it is, the main thread will perform
            the transition inside waitForData

            Likewise, if that texture is resident but will soon not be, it is still legal
            to access its contents as long as you access them from the main thread before
            that main thread changes the residency. This gives you a strong serialization
            guarantee, but be careful with async tickets such as AsyncTextureTickets:

            If you call
                AsyncTextureTicket *asyncTicket = textureManager->createAsyncTextureTicket( ... );
                assert( texture->getResidencyStatus() == GpuResidency::Resident );
                ... do something else that calls Ogre functionality ...
                assert( texture->getResidencyStatus() == GpuResidency::Resident );
                asyncTicket->download( texture, mip, true );
            Then the second assert may trigger because that "do something else" ended up
            calling a function inside Ogre that finalized the transition.
            Once you've called download and the resource was still Resident, you are
            safe that your data integrity will be kept.
        @remarks
            Beware of the ABA problem. If the following transitions are scheduled:
                OnStorage -> Resident -> OnStorage
            Then both getResidencyStatus & getNextResidencyStatus will return OnStorage.
            Use GpuResource::getPendingResidencyChanges to fix the ABA problem.
