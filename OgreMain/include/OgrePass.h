    /** Class defining a single pass of a Technique (of a Material), i.e.
        a single rendering call.
        @remarks
        Rendering can be repeated with many passes for more complex effects.
        Each pass is either a fixed-function pass (meaning it does not use
        a vertex or fragment program) or a programmable pass (meaning it does
        use either a vertex and fragment program, or both).
        @par
        Programmable passes are complex to define, because they require custom
        programs and you have to set all constant inputs to the programs (like
        the position of lights, any base material colours you wish to use etc), but
        they do give you much total flexibility over the algorithms used to render your
        pass, and you can create some effects which are impossible with a fixed-function pass.
        On the other hand, you can define a fixed-function pass in very little time, and
        you can use a range of fixed-function effects like environment mapping very
        easily, plus your pass will be more likely to be compatible with older hardware.
        There are pros and cons to both, just remember that if you use a programmable
        pass to create some great effects, allow more time for definition and testing.

            point sizes that cause the point sprites to get very large on screen,

        /** Sets whether or not this pass should iterate per light or number of
            lights which can affect the object being rendered.
        @remarks
            The default behaviour for a pass (when this option is 'false'), is
            for a pass to be rendered only once (or the number of times set in
            setPassIterationCount), with all the lights which could
            affect this object set at the same time (up to the maximum lights
            allowed in the render system, which is typically 8).
        @par
            Setting this option to 'true' changes this behaviour, such that
            instead of trying to issue render this pass once per object, it
            is run <b>per light</b>, or for a group of 'n' lights each time
            which can affect this object, the number of
            times set in setPassIterationCount (default is once). In
            this case, only light index 0 is ever used, and is a different light
            every time the pass is issued, up to the total number of lights
            which is affecting this object. This has 2 advantages:
            <ul><li>There is no limit on the number of lights which can be
            supported</li>
            <li>It's easier to write vertex / fragment programs for this because
            a single program can be used for any number of lights</li>
            </ul>
            However, this technique is more expensive, and typically you
            will want an additional ambient pass, because if no lights are
            affecting the object it will not be rendered at all, which will look
            odd even if ambient light is zero (imagine if there are lit objects
            behind it - the objects silhouette would not show up). Therefore,
            use this option with care, and you would be well advised to provide
            a less expensive fallback technique for use in the distance.
        @note
            The number of times this pass runs is still limited by the maximum
            number of lights allowed as set in setMaxSimultaneousLights, so
            you will never get more passes than this. Also, the iteration is
            started from the 'start light' as set in Pass::setStartLight, and
            the number of passes is the number of lights to iterate over divided
            by the number of lights per iteration (default 1, set by
            setLightCountPerIteration).
        @param enabled Whether this feature is enabled
        @param onlyForOneLightType If true, the pass will only be run for a single type
