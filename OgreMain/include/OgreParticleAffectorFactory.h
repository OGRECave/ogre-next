    @remarks
        Plugins or 3rd party applications can add new types of particle affectors to Ogre by creating
        subclasses of the ParticleAffector class. Because multiple instances of these affectors may be
        required, a factory class to manage the instances is also required.
    @par
        ParticleAffectorFactory subclasses must allow the creation and destruction of ParticleAffector
        subclasses. They must also be registered with the ParticleSystemManager. All factories have
        a name which identifies them, examples might be 'force_vector', 'attractor', or 'fader', and
        these can be also be used from particle system scripts.
