    @par
        They can define local textures and pass them to other nodes within the same
        workspace through their output channels.
        They can also receive textures through their input channels and send them through a
        different output channel to the next node(s).
        They can access global textures defined by the Workspace they belong to, but can't
        pass them to the output channels.
    @par
        How nodes input and output channels are wired together depends on the Workspace (See
        CompositorWorkspace and CompositorWorkspaceDef)
        A node cannot receive input from two nodes in the same channel, but it can send output
        to more than one node using the same output channel.
    @par
        A node whose workspace didn't connect all of its input channels cannot be executed,
        and unless it is disabled, the Compositor will be unable to render.
    @par
        The other core feature of nodes (besides textures and channels) is that they perform
        passes on RTs. A pass is the basic way to render: it can be a #PASS_SCENE, #PASS_QUAD,
        #PASS_CLEAR, #PASS_STENCIL, #PASS_RESOLVE
    @par
        This is the definition. For the instantiation, @see CompositorNode
    @remarks
        We own the local textures, so it's our job to destroy them
