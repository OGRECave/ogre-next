    /** Implementation of CompositorPass
        This implementation will render a fullscreen triangle/quad to the RenderTarget using
        the parameters from definition (rectangle area, whether triangle or quad pass,
        whether to include frustum corners, etc)
    @par
        A fullscreen quad are two triangles that form a rectangle, which cover the entire screen.
        This is however an inefficient way of harnessing the GPU's power. Modern GPUs iterate
        a whole bounding rect that encloses each triangle (it's highly more parallelizable & scalable
        than the scanline algorithm used by older Voodoo cards in the 90's). That means we're wasting
        50% of GPU reasources in pixels that aren't drawn.
    @par
        A much faster approach made famous by Emil Persson (see max area triangulation
        http://www.humus.name/index.php?page=News&ID=228) is to render a single oversized triangle
        that covers the entire screen, which has it's UV scaled up; so that when interpolated at
        screen position, it appears it goes from the range [0; 1) like a regular quad pass.
        The difference is that pixels that go past the viewport are much better clipped/earlied-out
        by the GPU than those that fall inside the viewport but outside the triangle (like the
        rectangle approach)
    @par
        This faster technique only works for passes that cover the entire screen. When the viewport
        is not 0 0 1 1; the CompositorPassQuad automatically switches to a fullscreen quad.
    @par
        <b>IMPORTANT:</b> The texel-to-pixel adjustment offset is included in the world matrix passed
        to the vertex shader. This differs from Ogre 1.x which tried to embed the offset into the
        vertices.
    @par
        <b>IMPORTANT:</b> When the viewport is not 0 0 1 1; the scale & position factors are passed
        through the world matrix. This behavior differs from Ogre 1.x
