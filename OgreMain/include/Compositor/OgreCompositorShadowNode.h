    /** Shadow Nodes are special nodes (not to be confused with @see CompositorNode)
        that are only used for rendering shadow maps.
        Normal Compositor Nodes can share or own a ShadowNode. The ShadowNode will
        render the scene enough times to fill all shadow maps so the main scene pass
        can use them.
    @par
        ShadowNode are very flexible compared to Ogre 1.x; as they allow mixing multiple
        shadow camera setups for different lights.
    @par
        Shadow Nodes derive from nodes so that they can be used as regular nodes
    @par
        During a render with shadow mapping enabled, we render first the Shadow Node's pass,
        then render the regular scene.
        In the past there used to be an AABB enclosing all visible objects that receive shadows
        that was used for calculating the shadow maps. This forced Ogre 2.x to split
        rendering into two stages: _cullPhase01 & _renderPhase02.
        This is not needed anymore.

        To summarize: a normal rendering flow with shadow map looks like this:
            shadowNode->setupShadowCamera( normal->getVisibleBoundsInfo() );
            shadowNode->_cullPhase01();
            shadowNode->_renderPhase02();
            normal->_cullPhase01();
            normal->_renderPhase02();
    @par
    @par
        On forward lighting passes, shadow mapping is handled in the following way:
            1) Build a list of all lights visible by all cameras (SceneManager does this)
            2) Traverse the list to get the closest lights to the current camera.
               These lights will cast shadows.
            3) Build a list of the closest lights for each object (SceneManager does this)
            4) Traverse this list and find those that are actually casting a shadow
            5) Send to the GPU & engine the list in step 4, but shadow casting lights are
               put first, then sorted by proximity.
        See the comments inside the function setShadowMapsToPass for more information.

        /** Marks a shadow map as statically updated, and ties the given light to always use

        @remarks
            By default Ogre recalculates the shadow maps every single frame (even if nothing
            has changed). However if you know that whatever a light is illuminating is not
            changing at all (or barely changing), with static shadow maps you are the one who
            tells Ogre when to update it (e.g. you may only need to update it three times during
            the whole level); hence the framerate goes up.
            Perceived quality may also go up because by default Ogre applies shadow mapping on the
            closest lights; so shadows flip on and off as you move the camera (because lights that
            had no shadows get closer while lights that were using shadows get farther away).
            While often this is desirable, there are cases where the artist may want a particular
            light to always have shadows (regardless of distance); with static shadow maps you can
            force that; hence the perceived quality may go up (but that's up to the talent of the
            artist and the scene in particular).
        @par
            Note that for point & spot lights, you have to consider if the light changed
            (e.g. moved, rotated) or if anything that is or could be lit by the light has moved
            Directional lights are harder because they depend on the camera placement as well.
        @par
            Use setStaticShadowMapDirty to tell Ogre to update the shadow map in the next render.
        @par
            Ogre may call light->setCastShadows( true ); on the light.
        @par
            IMPORTANT: Do not put static and dynamic shadow maps in the same UV atlas.
            It's asking for trouble and will probably not work. Keep the atlas separate.
        @par
            VERY IMPORTANT: You *must* respect lights are set in the following order:
                1. Directional
                2. Point
                3. Spot
            If you have shadow maps defined that support both point & spotlight, and you want
            to mix both static lights with dynamic ones; set fixed point lights in the first
            shadow map indices and spotlight in the last indices, to avoid Ogre automatically
            (e.g.) placing a point light after your static spot light.
        @param shadowMapIdx

            any of the split that belong to the same set)
