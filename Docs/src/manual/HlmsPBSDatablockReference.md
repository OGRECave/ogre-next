Reference Guide: HLMS PBS Datablock {#hlmspbsdatablockref}
===============================

- Reference for a datablock for the PBS HLMS implementation
- A Datablock is a "material" from the user's perspective. It is the only mutable block. It holds data (i.e. material properties) that will be passed directly to the shaders, and also holds which Macroblock, Blendblocks and Samplerblocks are assigned to it.
- Datablocks are located in JSON material filename: `[name].material.json`
- When loading a texture, if no sampler is provided, a default one from the HLMS is supplied
- All parameters are optional. Defaults are provided.

# Common Datablock Parameters: {#dbCommonParameters}

## Parameter: alpha_test {#dbParamAlphaTest}
- Sets the alpha test to the given compare function
- Alpha_test value is type array:
    - First value is a string and sets the compare function.
        - Valid values for the compare function: `less`, `less_equal`, `equal`, `not_equal`, `greater_equal`, `greater`, `never`, `always` and `disabled`
    - The second is a float and sets the test's threshold. Value typically in the range [0; 1) 
    - Optional third is a bool that sets weather to alpha test shadow caster only
- **DEFAULT=["disabled",0.5,false]** 

## Parameter: blendblock {#dbParamBlendBlock}
- Sets the blendblock definition
- Two value variations:
    - Type 1: Value is type string, the name of a blendblock definition. Example: `"blendblock" : "blendblock_name"`
    - Type 2: Value is type string array:
        - First array value is the name of a blendblock definition
        - Second array value is the name of a blendblock definition for shadows
        - Example: `"blendblock" : ["blendblock_name","blendblock_name_for_shadows"]`

## Parameter: macroblock {#dbParamMacroBlock}
- Sets the macroblock definition
- Two value variations:
    - Type 1: Value is type string, the name of a macroblock definition. Example: `"macroblock" : "macroblock_name"`
    - Type 2: Value is type string array:
        - First array value is the name of a macroblock definition
        - Second array value is the name of a macroblock definition for shadows
        - Example: `"macroblock" : ["macroblock_name","macroblock_name_for_shadows"]`

## Parameter: shadow_const_bias {#dbParamShadowConstBias}
- Sets the shadow_const_bias value
- Value of type float
- **DEFAULT=0.01**

# PBS Datablock Parameters {#dbPBSParameters}

## Parameter: brdf {#dbParamBRDF}
- Defines the brdf mode
- Valid values:
    - `default`: Most physically accurate BRDF Ogre has. 
        - Uses: Good for representing the majority of materials.
    - `cook_torrance`: Cook-Torrance implementation of BRDF.
        - Uses: Ideal for silk (use high roughness values) and synthetic fabrics.
    - `blinn_phong`: Implements Normalized Blinn Phong using a normalization factor of (n + 8) / (8 * pi). Looks similar to `default` but has increased performance.
    - `default_uncorrelated`: Same as Default, but the geometry term is not height-correlated which most notably causes edges to be dimmer and is less correct.
        - Uses: Closest resemblance to Unity if an exchangeable pipeline is advantageous.
    - `default_separate_diffuse_fresnel`: Same as Default but the fresnel of the diffuse is calculated differently. When using this BRDF, the diffuse fresnel will be calculated differently, causing the diffuse component to still affect the colour even when the fresnel = 1 (although subtly). To achieve a perfect mirror you will have to set the fresnel to 1 and the diffuse colour to black; which can be unintuitive for artists.
        - Uses: Materials with complex refractions and reflections like glass, transparent plastics, fur, and surface with refractions and multiple rescattering that cannot be represented well with the default BRDF. 
    - `cook_torrance_separate_diffuse_fresnel`: Similar to 'DefaultSeparateDiffuseFresnel' but the Cook Torrance model is used instead.
        - Uses: Shiny objects like glass, toy marbles, some types of rubber, silk and synthetic fabric.
    - `blinn_phong_separate_diffuse_fresnel`: Similar to 'DefaultSeparateDiffuseFresnel' but uses BlinnPhong as base. 
    - `blinn_phong_legacy_math`: Implements traditional / the original non-PBR blinn phong. Notes:
        - Results in graphical look of 2000-2005 game
        - Ignores fresnel completely
        - Works with Roughness in range (0, 1] (converted to shininess)
        - Assumes your Light power is set to PI (or a multiple)
        - Diffuse & Specular will automatically be multiplied/divided by PI
        - One of the fastest BRDF implementations
    - `blinn_phong_full_legacy`: Implements traditional / the original non-PBR blinn phong. Notes:
        - Results in graphical look of 2000-2005 game
        - Ignores fresnel completely
        - Roughness is actually the shininess parameter in range (0, inf) although most used ranges are in (0, 500]
            - Assumes your Light power is set to 1.0.
            - Diffuse & Specular is unmodified
            - The fastest BRDF implementations
            - Use this implementation for ease of porting from Ogre 1.X and to maintain the fixed-function look. 
            - If switching from the 'default' BRDF implementation, the scene will be too bright. If so, divide light power by PI.

    - `oneSidedShadowCast` type [CullingMode]: 	If changeMacroblock == true; this parameter controls the culling mode of the shadow caster (the setting of HlmsManager::setShadowMappingUseBackFaces is ignored!). While oneSidedShadowCast == CULL_NONE is usually the "correct" option, setting oneSidedShadowCast=CULL_ANTICLOCKWISE can prevent ugly self-shadowing on interiors. In the json interpreter, this value is set to the CullingMode of the Macroblock.


## Parameter: workflow {#dbParamWorkflow}
- Defines the workflow of the material
- Valid values:
    - `specular_ogre`: Ogre implementation of specular workflow. Specular texture is used as a specular texture, and is expected to be either coloured or monochrome. setMetalness should not be called in this mode. 
    - `specular_fresnel`: Equivalent to what other implementations often refer to as "specular workflow". Specular texture is used as a specular texture, and is expected to be either coloured or monochrome. setMetalness should not be called in this mode.
    - `metallic`: Metallic workflow. The texture is used as a metallic texture and expected to be monochrome. Fresnel setting should not be used.
- **DEFAULT="specular_ogre"**
