GUIDE TO BUILDING OGRE
========================================================================

See instructions in https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre-next/api/2.3/_setting_up_ogre.html

You will also find those instructions under Docs/src/SettingUpOgre


1. Building Ogre as Windows Store or Windows Phone application
-------------------------------------------------------------------

You need Windows 8.0 or later, Windows 8.1 is recommended.

You need Visual Studio 2012 or later, Visual Studio 2013 is recommended
as it is bundled with WinStore 8.0/8.1 and WinPhone 8.0/8.1 SDKs.

Download and install CMake 3.15.5 or later.

Patched dependencies must be used, compiled with appropriate WINAPI_FAMILY.
Cg is not supported, and only headers from OIS are needed. 
You can use https://bitbucket.org/eugene_gff/ogre-dependencies-winrt - 
has VS2012 and VS2013 projects for Win32, WinRT (can be reused for WinPhone)
Compile dependencies for all configurations that you plan to use before
running CMake. Dependencies for Win32 and for WinRT must be located in
separate folders, Win32 version can be built from OgreDependencies.VS201x.sln,
 WinRT from OgreDependencies.VS201x.WinRT.sln

Run CMake, specify source and binaries folders, than "Configure", select
"Visual Studio 12 2013" generator and "Specify options for cross-compiling"
option, specify Operating System = "WindowsStore" or "WindowsPhone",
Version = "8.0" or "8.1", than "Finish", specify WinRT dependencies folder
for OGRE_DEPENDENCIES_DIR, "Configure", should be no more errors, then press
"Generate". If you want build time to be shorter - set OGRE_UNITY_BUILD to on.

Select SampleBrowser as the start up project and run.

Note 1: The code and generated cmake solution should be on local NTFS drive,
and can't be on a network drive, including VMWare shared folders - or
you will get a errors when you will try to compile/link/run resulting exe.

Note 2: Ogre uses d3dcompiler_xx.dll to compile shaders, and WinStore and
WinPhone 8.1 projects can use it without restriction as it is part of OS.
But WinStore and WinPhone 8.0 applications should load already compiled
shaders from cache, as d3dcompiler_xx.dll is available to them only during
development. Therefore to avoid necessity to deploy d3dcompiler_xx.dll
during development (additional configurations with d3dcompiler_xx.dll)
and generation of such cache - use version 8.1 of these platforms.

Note 3: Running WinPhone emulator in OS running under VMware:
We were able to run the emulation and debug without an issue by using two
steps: (a) Under the settings of the VM > CPU, make sure you have the
option to pass-through the Intel VT-x/EPT feature, (b) Edit the config
file .vmx and add the parameter: hypervisor.cpuid.v0 = "FALSE"
All versions of Visual Studio 2012 have a window refresh issue when running
in VMware and the window is maximized, the solution is just to change the
size of the Visual Studio window to be less the the screen width and height.
