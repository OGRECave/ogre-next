            By default the HDR implementation will try to auto adjust the
            exposure based on the scene's average luminance.
        @par
            If left unbounded, even the darkest scenes can look well lit
            and the brigthest scenes appear too normal.
        @par
            These parameters are useful to prevent the auto exposure from
            jumping too much from one extreme to the other and provide
            a consistent experience within the same lighting conditions.
            (e.g. you may want to change the params when going from indoors to
            outdoors)
        @par
            The smaller the gap between minAutoExposure & maxAutoExposure, the
            less the auto exposure tries to auto adjust to the scene's lighting
            conditions.
        @param exposure
            Exposure in EV. Valid range is [-inf; inf]
            Low values will make the picture darker.
            Higher values will make the picture brighter.
        @param minAutoExposure
            It's in EV stops. Valid range is [-inf; inf]
            Must be minAutoExposure <= maxAutoExposure
            Controls how much auto exposure darkens a bright scene.

            To prevent that looking at a very bright object makes the rest of
            the scene really dark, use higher values.
        @param maxAutoExposure
            It's in EV stops. Valid range is [-inf; inf]
            Must be minAutoExposure <= maxAutoExposure
            Controls how much auto exposure brightens a dark scene.

            the scene really bright, use lower values.
