    @remarks
    This class is simply a way of getting a font texture into the OGRE system and
    to easily retrieve the texture coordinates required to accurately render them.
    Fonts can either be loaded from precreated textures, or the texture can be generated
    using a truetype font. You can either create the texture manually in code, or you
    can use a .fontdef script to define it (probably more practical since you can reuse
    the definition more easily)
    @note
    This class extends both Resource and ManualResourceLoader since it is
    both a resource in it's own right, but it also provides the manual load
    implementation for the Texture it creates.

            as many times as required to define the range of glyphs you want to be
