        This solution is also integrated into HlmsPbs.

        It may seem counter-intuitive to include an NPR solution in a PBR solution (HlmsPbs)
        However it makes sense because it looks nice and is efficient for most cases.

        A PBR solution is iterative and requires more resources.
