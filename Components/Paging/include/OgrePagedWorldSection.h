    /** Represents a section of the PagedWorld which uses a given PageStrategy, and
        which is made up of a generally localised set of Page instances.
    @remarks
        The reason for PagedWorldSection is that you may wish to cater for multiple
        sections of your world which use a different approach to paging (ie a
        different PageStrategy), or which are significantly far apart or separate 
        that the parameters you want to pass to the PageStrategy are different.
    @par
        PagedWorldSection instances are fully contained within the PagedWorld and
        their definitions are loaded in their entirety when the PagedWorld is
        loaded. However, no Page instances are initially loaded - those are the
        responsibility of the PageStrategy.
    @par
        PagedWorldSection can be subclassed and derived types provided by a
        PagedWorldSectionFactory. These subclasses might come preconfigured
        with a strategy for example, or with additional metadata used only for
        that particular type of section.
    @par
        A PagedWorldSection targets a specific SceneManager. When you create one
        in code via PagedWorld::createSection, you pass that SceneManager in manually.
        When loading from a saved world file however, the SceneManager type and
        instance name are saved and that SceneManager is looked up on loading, or
        created if it didn't exist.
