    @remarks
        This class acts as a grouping level for PageContent instances. Rather than 
        PageContent instances being held in a list directly under Page, which might 
        be the most obvious solution, this intermediate class is here to allow
        the collection of relevant PageContent instances to be modified at runtime
        if required. For example, potentially you might want to define Page-level LOD
        in which different collections of PageContent are loaded at different times.
