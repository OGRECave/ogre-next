        differently. Unlit is very fast, but also very basic. It's mostly useful for
        perfect mirrors.

        An unlit datablock is tied to a particular Actor (reflection plane).
        PBS on the other hand, can dynamically assign Renderables to the closest actor that
        aligns with the Renderable's (predominant) normal, regardless of the pbs datablock
        it uses. If the actor is close enough but not an exact match, PBS will attempt to
        project the reflection in an attempt to correct this, however it's an approximation.

        If you want perfect reflections, the reflection plane of the actor must match and align
        exactly the surface being drawn; or rely on a fallback (Local Cubemaps, SSR, etc).

        Furthermore, PBS will automatically disable reflections while rendering reflections
        (but Unlit won't do this, so it's your job to leave it out of rendering i.e.
        via visibility masks).

        Actors are culled against the camera, thus if they're no longer visible Ogre will
        stop updating those actors, improving performance.

            reasons you may only want 1-5 actors at the same time. Actors are dynamically
            activated based on distance to camera.
        @remarks
            Note HlmsPbs hardcodes the max number of actors, so changing
            this value after having rendered a few frames could cause many
            shaders to be recompiled.
        @param maxActiveActors
            New max active actors. Can be lower or higher than its previous value.
            When this value is less or equal than current value, all the next parameters
            are ignored.
            When this value is higher than its previous, value, the new active actors
            will use these parameters; which don't have to necessarily match previous
            calls (not recommended since we assume the number of mipmaps is the same for all
            actors. This affects surfaces with roughness > 0).
        @param workspaceName
            Workspace to use for rendering.
        @param useAccurateLighting
            When true, overall scene CPU usage may be higher, but lighting information
            in the reflections will be accurate.
            Turning it to false is faster. This is a performance optimization that rarely
            has a noticeable impact on quality.
        @param width
            Width resolution of the RTT assigned to this reflection plane
        @param height
            Height resolution of the RTT assigned to this reflection plane
        @param withMipmaps
            When true, mipmaps will be created; which are useful for glossy reflections
            (i.e. roughness close to 1). Set this to false if you only plan on using
            it for a mirror (which are always a perfect reflection... unless you want
            to use a roughness map to add scratches & stains to it).
        @param pixelFormat
            Pixel Format of the RTT assigned to this reflection plane
        @param mipmapMethodCompute
            Set to true if the workspace assigned via PlanarReflectionActor::workspaceName
            will filter the RTT with a compute filter (usually for higher quality).

            Reservation is useful to have a texture be linked always with the same actor,
            which can be used to avoid updating it while still showing a (partially wrong)
            reflection (as a performance improvement) or for using actors with HlmsUnlit,
