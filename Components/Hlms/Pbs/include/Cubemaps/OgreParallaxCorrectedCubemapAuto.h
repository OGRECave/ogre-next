        Per-Pixel reflection probes.

        Per-Pixel reflection probes are much easier to handle, they're more flexible and powerful.
        However they require a modern GPU with Cubemap Arrays.
        Forward Clustered also must be active.

        ParallaxCorrectedCubemapAuto supports having more CubemapProbes than the maximum number
        of probes you pass to ParallaxCorrectedCubemapAuto::setEnabled.
        However only 'maxNumProbes' probes can be active at the same time.
        This is all done thanks to _acquireTextureSlot & _releaseTextureSlot.

        To activate a probe, call CubemapProbe::initWorkspace.
        To deactivate it, call CubemapProbe::destroyWorkspace.

            DPM is lower quality than cubemap arrays. However not all GPUs support cubemap arrays,
            most notably iOS GPUs before A11 chips and DX10 level HW.

            When cubemap arrays are not supported, this setting is always forced on.<br/>
            When cubemap arrays are supported, it's up to you. The most likely reason you want to
            use DPM overy cubemap arrays is to see how it looks like on unsupported platforms.

            You cannot toggle this setting after enabling the system. You must call
            ParallaxCorrectedCubemapAuto::setEnabled( false, ... ); to switch this.
        @param useDpm2DArray
