                When specifying three values, the fresnel is separate for each
                colour component

            * fresnel_coeff <value [g, b]>
                Directly sets the fresnel values, instead of using IORs
                "F0" in most books about PBS

            * roughness <value>
                Specifies the roughness value. Should be in range (0; inf)
                Note: Values extremely close to zero could cause NaNs and
                INFs in the pixel shader, also depends on the GPU's precision.

            * background_diffuse <r g b a>
                Specifies diffuse colour to use as a background when diffuse texture are not present.
                Does not replace 'diffuse <r g b>'
                Default: background_diffuse 1 1 1 1

            * diffuse <r g b>
                Specifies the RGB diffuse colour. "kD" in most books about PBS
                Default: diffuse 1 1 1 1

            * diffuse_map <texture name>
                Name of the diffuse texture for the base image (optional)

            * specular <r g b>

                Name of the specular texture for the base image (optional).

            * roughness_map <texture name>
                Name of the roughness texture for the base image (optional)
                Note: Only the Red channel will be used, and the texture will be converted to
                an efficient monochrome representation.

            * normal_map <texture name>
                Name of the normal texture for the base image (optional) for normal mapping

            * detail_weight_map <texture name>
                Texture that when present, will be used as mask/weight for the 4 detail maps.
                The R channel is used for detail map #0; the G for detail map #1, B for #2,
                and Alpha for #3.
                This affects both the diffuse and normal-mapped detail maps.

            * detail_map0 <texture name>
              Similar: detail_map1, detail_map2, detail_map3
                Name of the detail map to be used on top of the diffuse colour.

              Similar: detail_blend_mode1, detail_blend_mode2, detail_blend_mode3

                    "NormalNonPremul", "NormalPremul", "Add", "Subtract", "Multiply",

              Similar: detail_offset_scale1, detail_offset_scale2, detail_offset_scale3
                Sets the UV offset and scale of the detail maps.

            * detail_normal_map0 <texture name>
              Similar: detail_normal_map1, detail_normal_map2, detail_normal_map3
                Name of the detail map's normal map to be used.
                It's not affected by blend mode. May be used even if
                there is no detail_map

            * detail_normal_offset_scale0 <offset_u> <offset_v> <scale_u> <scale_v>
              Similar: detail_normal_offset_scale1, detail_normal_offset_scale2,
                       detail_normal_offset_scale3
                Sets the UV offset and scale of the detail normal maps.

            * reflection_map <texture name>
                Name of the reflection map. Must be a cubemap. Doesn't use an UV set because
                the tex. coords are automatically calculated.

            * uv_diffuse_map <uv>
              Similar: uv_specular_map, uv_normal_map, uv_detail_mapN, uv_detail_normal_mapN,
                       uv_detail_weight_map
              where N is a number between 0 and 3.
                UV set to use for the particular texture map.
                The UV value must be in range [0; 8)

            * transparency <value>
              Specifies the transparency amount. Value in range [0; 1]
              where 0 = full transparency and 1 = fully opaque.

            * transparency_mode <transparent, none, fade>
              Specifies the transparency mode. @see TransparencyModes

            * alpha_from_textures <true, false>
              When set to false transparency calculations ignore the alpha channel in
              the textures

        @remarks
            PCC (Parallax Corrected Cubemaps) have two main forms of operation: Auto and manual.
            They both have advantages and disadvantages. This method allows you to enable
            the manual mode of operation.
        @par
            Manual Advantages:
                * It's independent of camera position.
                * The reflections are always visible and working on the object.
                * Works best for static objects
                * Also works well on dynamic objects that you can guarantee are going
                  to be constrained to the probe's area.
            Manual Disadvantages:
                * Needs to be manually applied on the material by the user.
                * Can produce harsh lighting/reflection seams when two objects affected
                  by different probes are close together.
                * Sucks for dynamic objects.

            To use manual probes just call:
                datablock->setCubemapProbe( probe );
        @par
            Auto Advantages:
                * Smoothly blends between probes, making smooth transitions
                * Avoids seams.
                * No need to change anything on the material or the object,
                  you don't need to do anything.
                * Works best for dynamic objects (eg. characters)
                * Also works well on static objects if the camera is inside rooms/corridors, thus
                  blocking the view from distant rooms that aren't receiving reflections.
            Auto Disadvantages:
                * Objects that are further away won't have reflections as
                  only one probe can be active.
                * It depends on the camera's position.
                * Doesn't work well if the user can see many distant objects at once, as they
                  won't have reflections until you get close.

            To use Auto you don't need to do anything. Just enable PCC:
                hlmsPbs->setParallaxCorrectedCubemap( mParallaxCorrectedCubemap );
            and leave PBSM_REFLECTION empty and don't enable manual mode.
        @par
            When other reflection methods can be used as fallback (Planar reflections, SSR),
            then usually auto will be the preferred choice.
            But if multiple reflections/fallbacks aren't available, you'll likely have to make
            good use of manual and auto
        @param probe
            The probe that should affect this material to enable manual mode.
            Null pointer to disable manual mode and switch to auto.
