        @remarks
            If camera movement is deterministic, output is always deterministic
            regardless of this setting

            This value can be changed at any point and switch back and forth

        @param bConsistentCascadeSteps
            True:
            Results can feel very determnistic because it is predictable.

            Camera position is quantized in voxelCellSize * cascade.cameraStepSize.
            This means the camera position is in a 'cell' or 'grid'.

            When the camera position moves onto another grid, we partially revoxelize
            results.

            Advantage: A camera at pos XYZ will always have the same results

            Disadvantage: if the camera jumps back and forth between voxels,
            revoxelizations will trigger frequently causing obvious frequent jumps in brightness

            False:
            Revoxelization happens after the camera has travelled cascade.cameraStepSize cells
            away from the last point of voxelization.

            Advantage: Infrequent revoxelizations. If camera movement is restricted around
            the last voxelization point, we will never revoxelize.

            Disadvantage: Taking a picture at pos XYZ, then going away, and taking another
            picture at same pos XYZ may not result in the same brightness / image;
            which can make it feel unpredictable or non-deterministic.
            This can be workarounded by temporarily setting setConsistentCascadeSteps( true )
            then back false after taking the picture
