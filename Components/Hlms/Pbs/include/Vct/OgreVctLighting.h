        /** When roughness is close to 0.02, specular cone tracing becomes path tracing.
            This is very slow. However we can greatly speed it up by skipping gaps of empty
            voxels.

            We use the alpha (opacity) component of the higher mips to approximate
            the SDF (Signed Distance Field) and thus know how much to skip. This is
            theoretically wrong, but not very wrong because the mips are very close to
            its true SDF representation thus in it works practice.

            Some of these formulas have been empirically tuned to match a good
            performance/quality ratio

            Once the roughness is higher, this formula starts hurting quality (produces
            noticeable artifacts) and thus we disable it.

            This formula has tweakable parameters to leverage performance vs quality

            Recommended range is [0; 1] where 1 is high quality and 0 is high performance
            (artifacts may appear).

            However you can go outside that range.
        @remarks
            When resolution is <= 32; we completely disable this hack as it only hurts
            performance (fetching the opacity is more expensive than skipping pixels)

            Internally the lighting data is stored in RGBA8_UNORM_sRGB, which is not enough
            for HDR. More precise formats would allow for native HDR, however it's memory cost
            and bandwidth could be prohibtive.

            Hence bakingMult is used to bring down the lighting data to usable levels without
            saturation (however beware areas with very low lighting conditions may round to 0).

            During rendering, we use 1.0 / bakingMult to bring back the values its original range.

            For LDR rendering, you probably would want to set this value to 1.0.

            Values <= 1 make when your lights are very bright,
            but can cause low light to become 0 (too dark)

            Shadows are calculated by raymarching towards the light source. However sometimes
            the ray 'may go through' a wall due to how bilinear interpolation works.

            Bilinear interpolation can produce nicer soft shaddows, but it can also cause
            this light leaking from behind a wall.

            Increase this value (e.g. to 2.0f) to fight light leaking.
            This should generally (over-)darken the scene

            Lower values will lighten the scene and allow more light leaking

            Note that thinWallCounter can *not* fight all sources of light leaking,
            thus increasing it to ridiculous high values may not yield any benefit.

            Bigger values means the shadow raymarching during light injection
            pass is faster, but may cause glitches if too high (areas that
