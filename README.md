# OGRE3D (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine)

Visual Studio 2013 [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/ogrecave/ogre-next?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/ogrecave/ogre-next?svg=true)

Ogre is a 3D graphics rendering engine. Not to be confused with a game engine, which provides Networking, Sound, Physics, etc.
This project provides advanced, efficient modern 3D rendering capabilities.

This is the repository where the 2.x branch is actively developed on.
Active development of the 1.x branch happens in https://github.com/OGRECave/ogre

Both branches are in active development. See [What version to choose?](https://www.ogre3d.org/about/what-version-to-choose) to understand the differences between 1.x and 2.x

Both mirrors are periodically synced.

# Dependencies

* [CMake 3.x](https://cmake.org/download/)
* Mercurial. We recommend [TortoiseHg](https://tortoisehg.bitbucket.io/download/index.html)
* For HW & SW requirements, please visit http://www.ogre3d.org/developers/requirements

# Dependencies (Windows)

* Visual Studio 2008 SP1 - 2017 (2019 not tested). MinGW may work but we strongly recommend Visual Studio.
* [DirectX June 2010 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812). Optional.
  Needed if you use older Visual Studio versions and want the D3D11 plugin. Also comes with useful tools.
* Windows 10 SDK. Contains the latest DirectX SDK, thus recommended over the DX June 2010 SDK,
  but you may still want to install the June 2010 SDK for those tools.
* Windows 7 or newer is highly recommended. For Windows Vista & 7, you need to have the
  [KB2670838 update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2670838) installed.
  **YOUR END USERS NEED THIS UPDATE AS WELL**.

# Dependencies (Linux)

* Clang >3.5 or GCC >4.0

Debian-based. Run:

```
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libfreeimage-dev libzzip-dev libxrandr-dev libxaw7-dev freeglut3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev doxygen graphviz python-clang-4.0 libsdl2-dev cmake ninja-build hg
```

Arch-based Run:

```
pacman -S freeimage freetype2 libxaw libxrandr mesa zziplib cmake gcc
```

# Quick Start

We provide quick download-build scripts under the [Scripts/BuildScripts/output](Scripts/BuildScripts/output) folder.

You can download all of these scripts [as a compressed 7zip file](https://bitbucket.org/sinbad/ogre/downloads/)

If you're on Linux, make sure to first install the dependencies (i.e. run the sudo apt-get above)

# Download and Building manually

If for some reason you want to do it by hand, there's no script for your platform,
or you want to learn what the scripts are actually doing, see
[Setting Up Ogre](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/api/2.1/_setting_up_ogre.html) from the Ogre manual.

# Manual

For more information see the [online manual](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre/api/2.1/manual.html).
The manual can build on Linux using Doxygen:

```
cd build/Debug
ninja OgreDoc
```
