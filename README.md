# OGRE3D (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine)

Ogre is a 3D graphics rendering engine. Not to be confused with a game engine which provides Networking, Sound, Physics, etc.

Ogre 2.3 has had a substantial overhaul to focus on high performance graphics using Data Oriented Design with:
 * Cache friendly Entity and Node layout
 * Threaded batch processing of Nodes, Frustum Culling and other techniques such as Forward Clustered
 * SIMD processing using AoSoA (Array of Structures of Arrays) memory layout
 * Texture loaded via background streaming

This makes Ogre suitable for projects aiming to have a **large number of objects on screen, or have tight rendering budgets such as VR.**

This is the repository where the 2.x branch is actively developed on.
Active development of the 1.x branch happens in https://github.com/OGRECave/ogre

Both branches are in active development. See [What version to choose?](https://www.ogre3d.org/about/what-version-to-choose) to understand the differences between 1.x and 2.x

Both repositories are compatible for merging, but have been split in separate ways as their
differences have diverged long enough.

| MSVC | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/OGRECave/ogre-next?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MatiasNGoldberg/ogre-next/branch/master)|

## Supported Backends

 * Direct3D 11
 * OpenGL 3.3+
 * Metal
 * Vulkan

## Supported Platforms

 * Windows (XP\*, 7, 8, 10)
 * Linux
 * macOS\*\*
 * iOS
 * Android\*\*\*

(\*) XP support is through GL3+. Recent drivers are needed. Old GPUs do not have stable GL drivers capable of running Ogre 2.x.<br/>
(\*\*) Metal Backend is highly recommended. GL backend is supported in macOS, but the window subsystem hasn't been ported to 2.3 yet.<br/>
(\*\*\*) Device must be Vulkan-capable. Android 7.0+ is supported; but Android 8.0+ is strongly recommended due to lots of driver bugs in older versions.<br/>

## Supported Compilers

 * Clang 3.3 or newer
 * GCC 5 or newer
 * VS2008 or newer
 
## Samples
For a list of samples and their demonstrated features, refer to the [samples section in the manual.](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre-next/api/2.3/_samples.html)

# Dependencies

* [CMake 3.x](https://cmake.org/download/)
* Git
* For HW & SW requirements, please visit http://www.ogre3d.org/developers/requirements
* Our source dependencies are grouped in [ogre-next-deps](https://github.com/OGRECave/ogre-next-deps) repo

# Dependencies (Windows)

* Visual Studio 2008 SP1 - 2017 (2019 not tested). MinGW may work but we strongly recommend Visual Studio.
* [DirectX June 2010 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812). Optional.
  Needed if you use older Visual Studio versions and want the D3D11 plugin. Also comes with useful tools.
* Windows 10 SDK. Contains the latest DirectX SDK, thus recommended over the DX June 2010 SDK,
  but you may still want to install the June 2010 SDK for those tools.
* Windows 7 or newer is highly recommended. For Windows Vista & 7, you need to have the
  [KB2670838 update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2670838) installed.
  **YOUR END USERS NEED THIS UPDATE AS WELL**.

# Dependencies (Linux)

* Clang >3.5 or GCC >4.0

Debian-based. Run:

```
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libfreeimage-dev libzzip-dev libxrandr-dev libxaw7-dev freeglut3-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev doxygen graphviz python-clang-4.0 libsdl2-dev cmake ninja-build git
```

Arch-based Run:

```
pacman -S freeimage freetype2 libxaw libxrandr mesa zziplib cmake gcc
```

# Quick Start

We provide quick download-build scripts under the [Scripts/BuildScripts/output](Scripts/BuildScripts/output) folder.

You can download all of these scripts [as a compressed 7zip file](https://bintray.com/darksylinc/ogre-next/download_file?file_path=build_ogre_scripts-master.7z)

If you're on Linux, make sure to first install the dependencies (i.e. run the sudo apt-get above)

# Download and Building manually

If for some reason you want to do it by hand, there's no script for your platform,
or you want to learn what the scripts are actually doing, see
[Setting Up Ogre](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre-next/api/2.3/_setting_up_ogre.html) from the Ogre manual.

# Manual

For more information see the [online manual](https://ogrecave.github.io/ogre-next/api/2.3/manual.html).
The manual can build on Linux using Doxygen:

```
cd build/Debug
ninja OgreDoc
```

# Samples

If you want to test or evaluate Ogre, you can try the [prebuilt samples for Windows](https://bintray.com/darksylinc/ogre-next/download_file?file_path=ogre-samples-windows-x64-vs2015.7z).

# Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, go to Scripts/UnitTesting and to generate the comparison files type:

```
python3 RunUnitTests.py gl ../../build/Debug/bin/ ./JSON ../../build/UnitTestsOutput/
```

to check the diff against already generated data:

```
python3 RunUnitTests.py gl ../../build/Debug/bin/ ./JSON ../../build/UnitTestsOutput/ ../../build/UnitTestsOutput_old/
```
